## Acrobatic Fighter
*`Prerequisite: 16+ Dexterity`*

You’ve adopted a quick, agile, and mobile fighting style, using your environment to your advantage.

You can calculate your jump distance and height using your Dexterity score. Your jump distance and height are doubled. You’ve learned to use the environment around you to enhance your strikes. Whenever you make an unarmed strike while within 1 meter of a solid surface or object, such as a pole, you can use it to leverage a powerful attack, dealing an additional damage die with your unarmed strike. If no solid surfaces are available, you can use half your movement speed to drop to the ground on your hands, extending your legs upward to make a powerful kick.

Once per turn, when you fall onto a creature, make a DC 10 Acrobatics check. On a success, you may make one unarmed strike against that creature.

## Cursed Martial Artist
*`Prerequisite: Unarmed strike damage die of d10+, Cursed Strike Enhancement feature, 8th level`*

Your expertise in unarmed combat surpasses that of others at a similar skill level through advanced training and mastery of this martial discipline.

You gain the following benefits:

- Your unarmed strikes, when benefiting from the Cursed Strike enhancement, have their critical hit range increased by 1 (For example, if you would score a critical hit on a roll of 20, you can now score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 while using Cursed Strike). Additionally, whenever you score a critical hit with an unarmed strike, you can roll one additional unarmed strike damage die to determine the extra damage for the critical hit.

- If you have taken the Attack action on your turn and only used unarmed strikes, when you make an unarmed strike benefiting from Cursed Strike as a bonus action, the cursed energy cost of the enhancement is reduced by 2 (to a minimum of 1).

- As a reaction, when a creature fails a melee attack roll against you, you can make one unarmed strike against them. On a successful hit, you can add your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage roll.

## Shiranui-Gata
*`Prerequisite: 16+ Strength`*

Shiranui-Gata is a stance typically used by sumo wrestlers during the opening ceremony. The user assumes the stance by squatting with their head forward and arms extended outward in both directions, preparing to brace for impact and grab an enemy. 

As an action, you can enter this stance. Once in the stance, you can use your reaction against an enemy within range who attempts to hit you with a melee attack roll. If they hit, you take only half damage and may attempt to grapple them with advantage. The stance ends when you successfully grapple a creature.

## Slam Master
*`Prerequisite: 16+ Strength`*

You fight like a beast on the battlefield, focusing on tossing your opponents around. You gain the following two Slam abilities:

***Brute Slam.*** Once per turn, as part of an unarmed strike, you can attempt to grapple a creature. If successful, you may pick up the creature and slam it into a solid surface within 3 meters of you, such as the ground or a wall, dealing additional damage equal to another roll of your martial arts die. The surface takes twice as much damage as the creature, and if it breaks, the creature takes an additional 2d6 damage of an appropriate type.

***Heavy Slam.*** When you take the Attack action against a creature you are grappling, you may forgo one attack to violently slam the creature into the ground. Make a contested Strength (Athletics) check against the creature, who can contest with either a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (their choice). On a successful check, you drive the creature into the earth, ending your grapple early, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to two rolls of your martial arts die, and knocking the creature prone. On a failed check, the creature escapes your grapple, moving an additional 1 meter away as part of its successful check. If you roll a 20 on the Strength (Athletics) check and succeed, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to four rolls of your martial arts die, and gains disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and Strength or Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn.

## Unblockable Drumming Beat
*`Prerequisites: 18+ Strength, must be a Cursed Corpse and have the Gorilla Core`*

The Unblockable Drumming Beat is a physical technique where each of your strikes resonates throughout the target's body. Even if the opponent blocks, the impact still damages them with the full force of the attack. 

As a bonus action, for 5 cursed energy, you can start the drumming beat. Every unarmed strike you make thereafter for 1 minute is affected by the drumming beat. 

If you miss an unarmed strike by 5 or less of the target's AC, the attack still hits, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take the damage of the unarmed strike; on a success, they take no damage.
