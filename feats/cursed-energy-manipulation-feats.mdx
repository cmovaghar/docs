## Divine Cursed Energy Output
*`Prerequisites: 18th level, 20+ Charisma, must have all Cursed Energy Enhancement options, Legendary Cursed Energy Output feat`*

Achieving complete mastery over your cursed energy output allows you to dramatically alter the capabilities of your jujutsu techniques and abilities. As part of any feature that uses cursed energy, you can expend 8 cursed energy to drastically modify its effects as part of the same action you use the feature. If the feature is a Cursed Energy attack, the target's AC is treated as if it were reduced by half of your proficiency bonus (rounded down), plus 1. If the feature involves a Cursed Energy saving throw, you may change the saving throw to a different one based on its original type. The possible changes are listed below:

|Original Saving Throw|Changed Saving Throw|
|:-:|:-:|
|Strength|Dexterity|
|Dexterity|Constitution|
|Constitution|Strength|
|Intelligence|Wisdom|
|Wisdom|Intelligence|

Your Cursed Energy Enhancements are also impacted by your extraordinary cursed energy output in the following ways:

- Reinforced Cursed Strike: Whenever you use a Cursed Strike, its damage tier increases by one.
- Reinforced Cursed Armor: While your Cursed Armor is active, you regain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus at the start of each of your turns. These temporary hit points cannot exceed the maximum amount of armor you can have.
- Reinforced Cursed Weapon Enhancement: Whenever you attack with a weapon enhanced by Cursed Weapon Enhancement, your reach increases by 1 meter.
- The maximum cursed energy limit for Cursed Energy Slash, Cursed Energy Ray, and Cursed Energy Explosion is now doubled.

Finally, whenever you use a cursed energy-based feature and amplify its output using Improved Cursed Energy Output, you can apply two benefits instead of one by expending cursed energy equal to the feature’s cost (minimum of 1).

## Chanting
*`Prerequisites: Must have a Cursed Technique, 12th level, 14+ Intelligence or 14+ Wisdom, 17+ Charisma`*

You have gained the ability to recite chants for your Innate Technique features. An example chant is, “Polarized light, crow and declaration, between front and back.”

You may choose one of your Innate Technique features and recite a chant as an Action. The next time you use that feature, within two turns starting on your next turn, it will gain two of the following benefits of your choice:

- Your technique will ignore resistances and treat immunities as resistances.
- You may double the original Range, Width, or Radius of your technique.
- You may triple the original Range, Width, or Radius of your technique. (You must have doubled the range through chanting before applying this bonus).
- If the Innate Technique feature requires a saving throw, the target(s) make their save with disadvantage. You also raise the DC by your proficiency bonus for that saving throw.
- If your Innate Technique feature requires an attack roll, you gain advantage on the attack and may add your proficiency bonus to that roll an extra time.
- The cost of your Innate Technique feature is halved.
- Your Innate Technique ignores all forms of cover.
- The Action cost of your Innate Technique is reduced by 1 (e.g. Full Round Action → Action → Bonus Action → Free Action). If the feature is a Reaction and its Action Cost is reduced, you gain an extra Reaction for that feature. (You must be Complex Chanting to apply this bonus).
- The duration of your Innate Technique is doubled.
- The duration of your Innate Technique is tripled. (You must have doubled the duration through chanting before applying this bonus).
- If your Innate Technique inflicts damage by forcing a target to make a save, it will ignore features like Evasion if they fail the save by 5 or more. (You must be Complex Chanting to apply this bonus).
- The cost of your Innate Technique is reduced to ¼. (You must be Complex Chanting to apply this bonus and have already halved the cost through chanting. This reduction replaces, rather than stacks with, the ½ reduction).
- If your Innate Technique forces an opponent to make a saving throw, they roll 3 dice instead of 1 and take the lowest result. (You must be Complex Chanting to apply this bonus).
- If your Innate Technique requires an attack roll, you may roll 3 dice instead of 1 and take the highest result. (You must be Complex Chanting to apply this bonus).

Every subsequent turn you spend your Action chanting the technique, it will gain two additional bonuses of your choice. The chanted technique can only have a number of bonuses applied to it equal to 1 + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier. In addition, the final damage of the chanted Innate Technique feature will be boosted by 20% for each round you spend chanting. (After all dice are rolled, multiply the total damage by 1.2). This damage bonus is capped at 100% (2x Damage).

Instead of using an Action, you can perform a more complex variation of Chanting that combines both intricate hand signs and recitations as a Full Round Action. When Chanting in this manner, you may add four bonuses from the above list to the chanted technique, and every subsequent turn you spend a Full Round Action chanting the technique will grant four additional bonuses of your choice. Additionally, the final damage of the chanted Innate Technique will be boosted by 50% for each round you spend Complex Chanting. This damage bonus is also capped at 100% (2x Damage).

While Chanting or Complex Chanting, you must maintain concentration as if concentrating on a spell.

If your Innate Technique feature benefits from Chanting and allows you to make more than one attack roll, forces a target to make multiple saves, or has multiple ranges, you may only apply the benefit to one of those components at a time. (For example, you could apply a saving throw disadvantage to the first saving throw of the technique, but to apply it to the second saving throw, you would need to add that bonus again). You cannot perform Maximum Output on an Innate Technique feature benefiting from Chanting. You cannot apply the benefits of Chanting to a Domain Expansion. You cannot ready an action for the Chanting feat.

## Cursed Energy Explosion
*`Prerequisites: 16+ Charisma`*

You can release a devastating burst of Cursed Energy from your body.

As an action, by spending Cursed Energy up to your Charisma modifier, you can unleash a burst of raw Cursed Energy. Every creature within a 10-meter radius of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. 

On a failed save, they take 1d12 damage plus additional dice equal to the amount of cursed energy spent in necrotic damage and are knocked back to the edge of the circle. 

On a successful save, they take half as much damage and are not knocked back.

The damage type of this technique may change, similar to the Cursed Strike and Cursed Weapon Enhancement features.

## Cursed Energy Manipulator
*`Prerequisites: 13+ Charisma, any Cursed Energy Enhancement`*

You have experimented with new ways to harness your cursed energy and have discovered an additional method of using it.

- Your Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You may choose an additional Cursed Energy Enhancement from the list of available options.

This feat can be taken multiple times.

## Cursed Energy Ray
*`Prerequisites: 16+ Charisma`*

You have learned to create powerful blasts of pure cursed energy. 

As an action, by spending cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier, you can launch a cursed energy ball in a 10-meter line. Upon reaching the end of the line, it explodes in a 5-meter radius, causing every creature within range to make a Dexterity saving throw. 

On a failed save, they take 1d12 damage plus additional dice equal to the amount of cursed energy spent in necrotic damage. 

On a successful save, they take half as much damage.

The damage type of this technique may change, similar to the Cursed Strike and Cursed Weapon Enhancement features.

## Cursed Energy Reinforcement
*`Prerequisites: 16th level, 16+ Strength or 16+ Dexterity or 16+ Constitution, Cursed Enhanced Body feat`*

Having continuously channeled cursed energy through your body at such an efficient rate, you can now reinforce it dynamically at an unconscious level. As long as you have at least 1 cursed energy, you gain the following benefits:

- When you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability check, you can add your Charisma modifier to the result.
- When calculating your jump distance and height, you can add your Charisma score to the distance and your Charisma modifier to the height. Additionally, both your jump distance and height are doubled.
- You can add your Charisma score when determining your carrying capacity. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is also doubled.
- When calculating your AC through Unarmored Defense, you can add half of your Charisma modifier to the final result. This additional instance of adding your Charisma score counts as if you were using two separate ability scores for the purposes of other features and rules.
- The Curse-Empowered Strikes class feature now inflicts an additional die of damage. The damage type from Curse-Empowered Strikes can be necrotic, bludgeoning, or another type if your Cursed Technique alters the feature.
- You gain an additional reaction. This extra reaction can only be used to provide a bonus to your saving throws from the feature granted by the Cursed Enhanced Body feat.

## Cursed Energy Slash
*`Prerequisites: 16+ Charisma, Cursed Weapon Enhancement feature`*

As an action, while Cursed Energy Weapon Enhancement is active on a weapon that deals slashing damage, you can spend Cursed Energy up to your Charisma modifier to unleash a massive cursed energy slash. All creatures in a 10-meter line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take damage equal to your weapon's damage plus a number of dice equal to the amount of cursed energy spent in necrotic damage. On a successful save, they take half as much damage.

The damage type of this technique may change based on your cursed technique.

## Cursed Enhanced Body
*`Prerequisites: 12th level, 16+ Strength or 16+ Dexterity or 16+ Constitution, 18+ Charisma`*

Your body is enhanced by cursed energy, allowing you to excel in physical tasks that would typically require years of training. You gain the following benefits:

- Whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, or Wisdom saving throw, you can spend cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier as a reaction to add the number of energy spent as a bonus to the saving throw.
- When attacking with your unarmed strikes or weapons you are proficient with, you can add half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down) to your attack and damage rolls. This applies only if you currently have 1 or more cursed energy.

## Cursed Projectiles
*`Prerequisites: Cursed Weapon Enhancement feature`*

You have learned to imbue your cursed energy into ranged weapons, enabling you to control any piece of ammunition fired from them. This also applies to weapons with the thrown property. 

While using Cursed Weapon Enhancement, you can imbue a ranged weapon, causing any ammunition shot from it to become Cursed Projectiles for the duration. These projectiles also add your Charisma modifier to the damage instead of any other modifier. 

When using Cursed Projectiles, you make ranged Cursed Energy Attacks instead of the usual attack method, and you can control their trajectory in midair, allowing attacks to ignore cover. 

Additionally, the projectiles will remain suspended in the air for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier, enabling you to continue making attacks with them as a Bonus Action until they hit a solid object or target, at which point they lose this property. 

You can attack with a number of pieces of ammunition this way up to your Charisma modifier each turn. Creatures within range can target your Cursed Projectiles to destroy them; they have 1 hit point and 10 AC.

## Falling Blossom Emotion
*`Prerequisites: Sorcerer Family Member background`*

Unlike Simple Domain, which nullifies the auto-hit attack of a Domain Expansion by manifesting the user’s own domain, Falling Blossom Emotion envelops the user in cursed energy that counterattacks when a domain's guaranteed hit makes contact. 

As an action or reaction against being affected by the sure-hit effect of a Domain Expansion, or upon seeing a Domain Expansion open, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to shroud yourself in cursed energy for 1 minute. This negates the sure-hit feature of the Domain Expansion. It prevents any Cursed Energy attack rolls from automatically hitting you and stops you from automatically failing any Cursed Energy saves caused by the Domain Expansion. 

Additionally, you gain special damage reduction equal to your Charisma modifier times your proficiency bonus, multiplied by two, plus your Charisma modifier times four. This applies to the sure-hit effect for the duration of the technique. If the damage from the Domain Expansion does not exceed this damage reduction, the damage and any effects it would apply are negated. This technique cannot prevent the effects or damage of non-physical attacks, such as mental attacks that deal psychic damage.

You can also use this technique offensively. As an action, for 5 Cursed Energy, you can surround yourself with cursed energy and prepare to make counterattacks for the next minute. When you receive an attack roll, you can use your reaction to make one melee weapon attack with advantage. On a hit, the attack is considered a critical hit and deals necrotic damage. After using this technique, you must spend an action to prepare it again before using the special attack.

If your cursed energy alters damage types for other features, it can also alter the damage type for Falling Blossom Emotion.

## Flawless Fundamentals
*`Prerequisites: 19th level, 20+ Charisma, must have all Cursed Energy Enhancement options, Cursed Energy Reinforcement feat, Improved Cursed Energy Output feat`*

Your cursed energy manipulation is unparalleled, and it may take centuries before another individual with your mastery is born. You select 2 of the following categories to have their cursed energy costs reduced:

|Category|Things Reduced|
|:-|:-|
|Enhancement and Reinforcement|All Cursed Energy Enhancements, Cursed Enhanced Body, and Air Jump.|
|Innate Techniques and Domain Expansion|Your Cursed Technique features and your Domain Expansion.|
|Reverse Cursed Technique or Regeneration|All cursed energy spent on Reverse Cursed Technique, Improved Reverse Cursed Technique, Improved Output, Regeneration, or Advanced Regeneration.|
|Cursed Energy Manipulation|All Cursed Energy Manipulation Feats.|
|Taijutsu|All Taijutsu Feats and Cursed Martial Arts.|
|Sorcerer Path|All features from your Sorcerer Path.|
|Barriers|All Barrier Technique Feats except for Domain Expansion.|
|Cursed Creations|All Cursed Creation Feats.|

For the selected categories, any features that require cursed energy expenditure have their cost reduced by twice your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 1 cursed energy). [For example, with a proficiency bonus of 6, this feat reduces the costs of features that require cursed energy by 12.]

Additionally, during a short rest, you can meditate for 30 minutes to replenish your expended energy. This allows you to regain cursed energy equal to half of your maximum (rounded up) after completing the rest.

If you later gain the Legendary Cursed Energy Output or Divine Cursed Energy Output feats, you can choose an additional 2 categories to reduce the cost of. If you have both output feats, the cost of all features that use cursed energy is reduced, and you gain the following benefit:

- You may choose one feature from either your Cursed Technique or Sorcerer Path that requires cursed energy. If Flawless Fundamentals and/or a Jujutsu Sorcerer (Jujutsu Kaisen Supplement) class feature reduces its cost by double its original amount, the feature’s cost becomes 0. A feature's cost can only be reduced to 0 a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier + 1 (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses of the '0' cost feature after finishing a long rest. This benefit does not apply to a Domain Expansion.

## Improved Cursed Energy Output
*`Prerequisites: 18+ Charisma, 12th level`*

Through extensive training, you have enhanced your cursed energy output, allowing you to amplify your Jujutsu techniques further. 

As part of any feature that uses cursed energy, you can expend additional cursed energy equal to half the feature’s original cost to amplify its output. This cannot be used on Domain Expansion.

Amplifying a feature this way grants one of the following benefits:

- The feature’s damage dice increase by half of your Charisma modifier, rounded down. If the feature does not deal damage dice, its damage bonus increases by a quarter of the original amount.
- The feature’s range increases by 1 meter times your Charisma modifier, plus 1. This increase does not apply to touch-based techniques.
- The feature’s bonus to hit increases by +2.
- The feature’s DC increases by +2.
- The feature’s duration increases by a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier, plus 1.

If a feature benefits from either Maximum Output or Chanting, and is already benefiting from this feat, its total cursed energy cost is reduced by your Charisma modifier, to a minimum of 1. This cursed energy reduction does not apply for the purposes of the Flawless Fundamentals feat.

## Innate Domain
*`Prerequisites: Cursed Spirit race, Special Grade or Pseudo-Special Grade, 18+ Charisma`*

As a powerful cursed spirit, you have learned how to imprint your very soul onto the world around you, manifesting your innate domain into reality. 

As an action, for 5 cursed energy, you can manifest your innate domain within an enclosed space. The domain fills the area and lasts until it is dispelled (which you can do at will with no action required), you fall unconscious, or you die. The area of your Innate Domain cannot overlap with a Domain Expansion. 

You choose how the inside of your innate domain looks, though if you have acquired a Domain Expansion, it should resemble it in some way. Work with your DM to determine the effect of your innate domain, such as having a larger interior with shifting terrain that you control, or forcing those inside to answer a specific question and inflicting negative effects depending on their answer.

Additionally, if you meet the requirements for a Complete Domain from the Domain Expansion feat, along with the prerequisites for that feat, and are in a combat encounter where your enemies are attempting to kill you while you have 1/4th or fewer of your maximum hit points, you may roll a Charisma saving throw at the beginning of each of your turns, with a DC equal to 10 + the number of levels you are below 20th level. On a success, you gain the Domain Expansion feat, and your domain is automatically completed. 

Finally, if you gain a Domain Expansion, you may replace this feat with any feat or cursed feat of your choice that you meet the prerequisites for, as long as it isn't a Body, Taijutsu, or Background feat.

## Legendary Cursed Energy Output
*`Prerequisites: 15th level, 20+ Charisma, Improved Cursed Energy Output feat, at least two Cursed Energy Enhancements`*

Your cursed energy output has become so efficient that the power you generate is legendary, and your more generalized applications are now at a master’s level. You gain the following benefits:

- Your Cursed Strike deals additional damage equal to your Charisma modifier plus 1 (minimum of 1, maximum of +6). You can also expend additional cursed energy equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to double the damage bonus from this feat.
- Your Cursed Armor grants you resistance to four damage types of your choice (excluding radiant and necrotic) while you have temporary hit points from the Cursed Energy Enhancement. You can change these damage resistances on a long rest or once per round as a bonus action or reaction while using the Cursed Energy Enhancement.
- Your Cursed Weapon Enhancement provides you with a bonus to your AC equal to half the cursed energy expended, rounded down, plus 1, as long as you are wielding the weapon with the enhancement applied to it.
- If you have Cursed Energy Slash, you can choose whether it creates a 20-meter line, a 10-meter cone, or a 6-meter radius around you (you are excluded from making the saving throw), dealing double damage to structures or objects in range. If you have Cursed Energy Ray, you can change the Dexterity saving throw to a Strength or Constitution saving throw, and it deals double damage to structures or objects in range. If you have Cursed Energy Explosion, the range of the explosion increases by 3 meters for every cursed energy expended, and it now deals double damage to structures or objects in range.
- Finally, if you use Improved Cursed Energy Output with either Maximum Output or Chanting on a feature, its total cursed energy cost is reduced by your Charisma modifier plus half your proficiency bonus, rounded up, to a minimum of 1. This cursed energy reduction does not apply for the purposes of the Flawless Fundamentals feat.
