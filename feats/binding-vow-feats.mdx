## Favored Vows
*`Prerequisites: 8th level, 17+ Intelligence, Binding Vow feature`*

Your deep understanding of Binding Vows grants you exceptional insight, allowing you to wield them with remarkable ease. Some of your Binding Vows are no longer taxing, and one of your vows is far more powerful than those of other sorcerers.

You gain the following benefits:

- Your Intelligence score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- During a long rest, one Binding Vow of your choice becomes a Favored Vow. This Binding Vow no longer counts toward your Binding Vow limit. A Favored Vow can be changed after 6 minus your Intelligence modifier number of days (with a minimum of 1) have passed since selecting it. You can have up to two Favored Vows at a time.
- During a long rest, if you have two Favored Vows, you may enhance one of them. This enhancement allows you to choose a number of features of the Binding Vow, up to a maximum equal to your Intelligence modifier (if the vow has more than one feature). The selected features have their limits and maximums doubled, but the downsides of the Favored Vow are also doubled. You may change which Favored Vow is enhanced during a long rest. You can only have one enhanced Favored Vow at a time.
