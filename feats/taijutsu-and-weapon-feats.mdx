## Afterimage Assault
*`Prerequisites: 20+ Dexterity, Blue Augmented Speed feat or Untraceable Speed feat`*

Through mastery of your immense speed, you have learned to create afterimages to even the odds against strong opponents. As a bonus action, you can spend cursed energy or stamina points up to twice your Charisma or Dexterity modifier to create a number of 1-hit point clones identical to you, up to half of the cursed energy spent. These clones can grant flanking and must remain within half of your movement speed from you. Once per round, you may swap positions with one of these clones as a bonus action or reaction to being targeted by an attack or forced to make a saving throw.

A creature can distinguish these clones from the original by making a Wisdom (Insight) check against your Cursed Energy save DC or your battle maneuver save DC. They have advantage on this check if they have the Cursed Energy Tracker feat and are focusing on you with it, but they make the check at disadvantage if you have the Cursed Energy Concealer feat activated or if stamina points were used instead of cursed energy. (If you have both Blue Augmented Speed and Untraceable Speed, you can create clones up to the full amount of cursed energy spent.)

## Black Flash
*`Prerequisites: Must have scored at least 3 critical hits in a single battle using a melee weapon attack, must have Cursed Strike feature or Cursed Weapon Enhancement feature`*

You have become deeply connected with your cursed energy and have unlocked the infamous Black Flash technique, amplifying the destructive potential of your attack. To use this feat, you must be able to use cursed energy and have either the Cursed Strike or Cursed Weapon Enhancement feature.

When you score a critical hit (natural 20) with a melee weapon attack that benefits from either Cursed Strike or Cursed Weapon Enhancement, you can choose to land a Black Flash. Before calculating damage, roll a d6 to determine how much additional Necrotic damage your Black Flash adds, using the table below:

|Number Rolled|Damage Dealt|
|:-:|:-:|
|1|1 damage|
|2|6 damage|
|3|16 damage|
|4|32 damage|
|5|56 damage|
|6|88 damage|

Additionally, the number of damage dice you roll for this critical hit increases by one, and the Black Flash will not occur if the attack would not hit (such as if it is negated by an ability).

Once you land a Black Flash, it becomes easier to land another. On your next attack (if within the same turn), a Black Flash will trigger on a natural 15 or higher, known as the "Black Flash DC." For every Black Flash after the second, the natural attack roll must be 1 higher than the previous. (For example, the third Black Flash lands on a 16, the DC becomes 17, and so on.) Failing to land a consecutive Black Flash resets the DC, requiring a natural 20 to regain it, starting at a DC of 15.

***In the Zone.*** Landing a Black Flash temporarily puts you "in the zone," unlocking 120% of your potential. You gain the following benefits for a number of minutes equal to the number of Black Flashes you hit that turn. These benefits last from the turn you landed the Black Flash until that many minutes have passed:

- You fully regain your reverse cursed technique pool, if applicable.
- If you’ve used your domain expansion and cannot use your cursed technique, you regain the ability to use your cursed technique even after "In the Zone" ends.
- You receive a +2 bonus to all your ability scores, including their maximums.
- Your unarmed strike damage dice tier is increased by 1 (e.g., d8 → d10 → d12 → 2d6...).
- Your cursed energy armor, if any, provides 5 more temporary hit points per cursed energy spent.
- Your cursed energy attack rolls are made with advantage, and creatures make your cursed energy saving throws with disadvantage (unless they are also in "In the Zone").
- Your cursed techniques deal an additional amount of damage dice equal to your proficiency bonus. (For example, if your technique deals 4d6 and your proficiency bonus is +3, it would become 7d6.)

## Heavy Finisher
*`Prerequisites: 20+ Strength, Colossal Physique feat`*

After mastering your strength, you have learned to harness it fully to destroy your opponents. Once per round, as part of hitting a melee attack, you can spend cursed energy or stamina points equal to your Charisma or Strength modifier to make the target make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d10 necrotic or bludgeoning damage per point spent and is thrown back a distance equal to 20 times your Strength modifier plus the number of energy or points spent, and is knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half as much damage, are pushed half as far, and are not knocked prone.

If the target hits an object while being thrown, both the target and the object take 1d12 bludgeoning damage. If the target hits a structure, they stop completely and take 1d12 bludgeoning damage per 3 meters left to travel, with the structure taking twice as much damage. If the target hits another creature, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or also take the damage from the Heavy Finisher and be pushed as well.

If you use the Colossal Physique feature to push back a creature on the same attack as this feature, the creature takes the higher knockback damage from either this feat or Colossal Physique, with the total knockback distance being whichever is greater.

Additionally, you can use Heavy Finisher to pin someone to the ground. Once per round, as part of hitting a melee attack against a prone creature, you can spend cursed energy or stamina points equal to your Charisma or Strength modifier to force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d10 necrotic or bludgeoning damage per point spent and is restrained on the ground. On a successful save, they take half as much damage, and their speed is halved until the beginning of your next turn. If they fail by 5 or more, they are also Confused until the beginning of your next turn.

The creature may attempt the Strength saving throw again at the beginning of their turns, ending the condition early on a success.

## Mind Games
*`Prerequisites: 12+ Intelligence, Expertise in Deception, 8th level`*

When an opponent can see through your physical movements, the best way to defeat them is to get inside their head. 

When you make an attack roll against an enemy for the first time on your turn, you can make a Deception check contested by their Insight check. If you win the roll, you gain advantage on attack rolls against that creature for 1 minute. At the end of the creature's turns, it may repeat the contested rolls, with each subsequent Deception check being reduced by 2.

## Personal Record
*`Prerequisite: Must have the Black Flash feat and have landed a Black Flash at least 4 times`*

The sparks of Black Flash do not choose their recipients, but you are the exception. Through your experience as a sorcerer, you have made a personal record of how many Black Flashes you’ve successfully landed. Your Black Flash DC is reduced from 15 to 10 for consecutive Black Flashes. The DC increases by 1 for every successful Black Flash you land after the first when performing consecutive Black Flashes (e.g., 10 → 11 → 12 → etc.).

## Protector’s Stance
*`Prerequisites: 20+ Constitution, Human Wall feat`*

You have reached the pinnacle of endurance, mastering the ability to harden your body and prepare yourself for any attack. As a bonus action, you can spend cursed energy or stamina points up to your Charisma or Constitution modifier to harden your skin and enhance your senses for 1 minute. During this time, you gain damage reduction equal to double the amount spent, but your movement speed is halved. You may end this stance at any time without using an action.

Whenever you are hit by a melee attack, you can make a melee attack against the attacker as a reaction. Additionally, for the duration of the stance, you gain one additional reaction specifically to use this feature.

## Shikigami Battle Master
*`Prerequisites: 16+ Dexterity, 14+ Charisma, 4th level`*

You have trained to fight up close, not relying entirely on your shikigami, but instead learning to synchronize with them. While within 3 meters of one of your shikigami, you can grant yourself or one of your shikigami advantage on an attack. If you or any of your shikigami attack the same target during the turn, you also gain advantage on those attacks.

Additionally, the action cost to control your shikigami is reduced by 1 (Action → Bonus Action → Free Action).

## Taijutsu Sorcery
*`Prerequisite: 16+ Strength or 16+ Dexterity, 2nd level`*

Instead of focusing on the mental and energy aspects of sorcery, you have chosen to hone in on the physical and martial aspects of sorcery.

You gain the following benefits:

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, simple weapons, and martial weapons.

- If you have a feature that allows you to use Dexterity for unarmed strikes and martial weapons, whenever you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or martial weapon, you can make one unarmed strike, shove, grapple, or weapon attack as a bonus action.

- Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you may take the Dodge action as a reaction to an attack roll made against you. However, this Dodge action only causes melee attacks against you to have disadvantage. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on a melee attack against you while using this variation of the Dodge action, you can make one attack against that creature, provided it is within range, once per round.

- Once per turn, you can make an unarmed strike or martial weapon attack with advantage (this does not grant an extra attack). If you already have advantage on an unarmed strike or martial weapon attack, you increase the critical hit range for that attack by 1 using this feature.
