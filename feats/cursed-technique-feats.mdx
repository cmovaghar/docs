## Feats without cursed technique requirements
These feats do not have a specific cursed technique requirement, but may have other prerequisites.

### Cursed Technique Reversal
*`Prerequisites: Reverse Cursed Technique feat, must have a Cursed Technique`*

Through constant practice with Reverse Cursed Technique, you have learned to reverse your own cursed technique. 

You gain the "Technique Reversal" of your Cursed Technique, as detailed at the end of your technique's description.

### Freed Spirit
*`Prerequisites: Must have Cursed Partner, 14th level`*

You and your spirit have finally reconciled, breaking the curse and allowing it to pass on to the afterlife. Before leaving, however, the spirit left you a gift. You gain the following benefits:

- Your Vengeful Spirit is now fully under your control and is no longer considered berserk when summoned. You automatically succeed on the Charisma (Persuasion) check to return your spirit to its dormant state.

- You gain the ability to restore your Cursed Energy pool using your Cursed Spirit's energy. As a bonus action while your spirit is Fully Manifested, you can gain an amount of cursed energy up to 4 times your Charisma modifier. Your Cursed Spirit will spend an equivalent amount of cursed energy. Cursed energy gained in this way cannot exceed your maximum, and if your Cursed Spirit does not have enough cursed energy to spend, you gain as much as it can.

- You can use your spirit’s Cursed Energy pool as a substitute when using your Cursed Technique.

- Your spirit is now a monstrosity (shikigami) and loses its vulnerability to radiant damage.

- If your spirit is reduced to 0 hit points or killed while Fully Manifested, it will regain 1 hit point and become stable, returning to its dormant state. It cannot manifest again in any form until you complete a long rest, including through maneuvers like Vengeful Spirit Protection.

Additionally, your spirit gains an aspect of your sorcerer path, if applicable. The spirit counts as your path for meeting feat prerequisites and ignores level prerequisites.

- **Barrier Master:** The spirit gains 2 Barrier Technique feats.
- **Cursed Corpse Expert:** The spirit gains the Cursed Corpse Creator feat, and when imbuing a cursed core with cursed energy, each point the spirit spends counts as 2.
- **Cursed Energy Manipulator:** The spirit gains 2 Cursed Energy Manipulation feats.
- **Low Reserves Sorcerer:** The spirit gains 1 perk, 1 improved perk, and 1 quirk.
- **Master of Vows:** The spirit gains the Binding Vow feature and the Vows Master feat.
- **New Shadow Style Master:** The spirit gains the New Shadow Style: Simple Domain feat, and either the Vowless Simple Domain feat or the Simple Domain Imbuement feat.
- **Positive Energy Master:** The spirit gains 2 Reverse Cursed Energy feats.
- **Shikigami Master:** The spirit can act as a medium for your shikigami and summon them itself.
- **Taijutsu Master:** The spirit gains 2 Taijutsu feats.
- **Weapon Master:** The spirit gains Cursed Weapon Enhancement and the Cursed Weapon Wielder feat.

## Auspicious Beast Summon feats
All of these feats require you to have the Auspicious Beast Summon cursed technique.

### Auspicious Beast Summon Five - Lotus
*`Prerequisites: Must have experienced Nirvana (reaching enlightenment or undergoing an extreme clarification experience, as determined by your DM), level 14`*

You have gained the favor of the master of the beasts you call upon. 

A number of times per long rest equal to your Charisma modifier, you can summon Kaichi, Reiki, Kirin, and Ryu simultaneously as a bonus action, paying their combined costs all at once. 

Additionally, if you have access to the "Auspicious Tendencies" feature, you can summon a "Dire" Auspicious Beast a number of times per long rest equal to your proficiency bonus minus 1 (minimum of 1), without paying the cursed energy cost.

## Blood Manipulation or Rot Technique feats
All of these feats require you to have the Blood Manipulation or Rot Technique cursed technique, unless stated otherwise in the prerequisites.

### Blood Aeration
You cannot yet produce blood from cursed energy, so you have developed a method of efficiently obtaining blood points by circulating the blood externally and bringing it back in. 

As a bonus action, you can spend 2 cursed energy and up to 15 hit points to activate this skill. For every hit point you use upon activation, you gain 3 blood points. These blood points flow in and out of your body while the skill is active.

You also gain access to a new attack using the blood outside your body. When you take the Attack action, you may replace your attacks with blood slashes, using the blood circulating outside your body to slash at enemies. You must make a cursed energy attack roll to deal 2d8 slashing damage on a hit. Each blood slash costs 1 blood point and has a range of 3 meters.

This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you run out of blood points. However, maintaining this skill is difficult, and you must concentrate to keep the blood flowing. If you lose concentration, all remaining blood points are lost.

### Blood Edge
*`Prerequisites: Blood Manipulation user, 4th level`*

By rotating your blood at high speed, you can increase its strength and create a lethal weapon from it. 

As a bonus action, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier in blood points and half as many blood points in cursed energy (rounded up) to create any non-magical melee weapon. These weapons count as magical for overcoming resistances and last for 1 minute. For every two blood points spent, the weapon gains one additional damage die (e.g., 1d6 → 2d6).

This ability cannot be used to create melee cursed tools.

This feat counts as an Extension Technique for the purposes of class features.

### Energy to Blood
*`Prerequisites: Reverse Cursed Technique feat or Cursed Spirit race or Death Painting race`*

You have developed a method to create an almost infinite supply of blood for your cursed techniques. 

Whenever you use a technique that requires blood points, you can spend additional cursed energy equal to the blood points needed for the technique, creating 3 blood points for each cursed energy spent.

In addition, you gain a new ability. As an action, you can spend 3 blood points to shoot off a limb towards an enemy of your choice. The limb is launched 10 meters towards the target. You may perform any action you would normally be able to do with a limb at this extended range, such as making an unarmed strike or attempting a grapple. If you land a grapple, you may pull yourself towards the target or the target towards you as part of this action.

Finally, if you are a Death Painting, you may ignore the death save prerequisite of Reverse Cursed Technique, and when you heal using it, you count as spending one more cursed energy than you actually did.

### Supernova
*`Prerequisites: Blood Manipulation user, 14th level`*

By creating small orbs of condensed blood, you can unleash devastating explosions of piercing blood particles. 

As an action while Convergence is active, you can spend 4 Cursed Energy and 4 Blood Points to create a small orb of blood that fits in your hand. You place it in an unoccupied space you can see within 10 meters. The orb remains for up to 1 minute. When it explodes, each creature within 3 meters must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 11d10 piercing damage and is knocked prone. On a success, they take half as much damage and are not knocked prone.

You can create a number of orbs up to your proficiency bonus at once, spending additional Cursed Energy and Blood Points for each orb. You may choose for the orbs to explode immediately upon creation or manually trigger their detonation as a reaction when a creature enters the explosion range.

This counts as an Extension Technique for the purposes of other features.

## Brain Technique feats
All of these feats require you to have the Brain Technique cursed technique.

### Necessary Precautions
*`Prerequisites: 15th level`*

Through your use of the Brain Technique and its crude capabilities, you have developed a method to “retain” an innate technique from a body you have inhabited, even after switching bodies. 

You can now choose to “retain” an innate technique from a body you’ve taken. While in the body of the innate technique you wish to keep, you can make it your “retained” technique, allowing you to continue using it even after switching bodies.

You may only have one technique retained at a time, and you can possess it alongside the innate technique of the current body you are inhabiting. If you choose to retain a different technique, the previous one will be lost to you.

Work with your DM to determine the parameters and conditions for how you retain an innate technique. This could be a long, complicated method that requires specific cursed feats, or a simpler, more straightforward approach. For example, your method may require the Barrier Master feat and involve slowly etching the technique into your brain using a complex barrier technique over several months.

## Construction feats
All of these feats require you to have the Construction cursed technique.

### Biological Armor
*`Prerequisites: 17th level`*

You have come to understand the importance of optimizing your cursed energy usage despite the inherent inefficiency of your technique. Through this understanding, you have learned to create a full suit of armor infused with biologically analyzed properties using liquid metal.

During a long rest, you can choose a number of biological functions you've analyzed equal to your proficiency bonus, provided they all belong to a single biological classification. Work with your DM to determine the properties of your biological armor, which can have a number of features equal to your proficiency bonus. All armors gain the following two features:

***Durability.*** The armor has hit points equal to your Charisma modifier times 20. As a free action or as a reaction to taking damage, you can spend cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier to restore 20 hit points to the armor for each cursed energy spent.

***Partial Manifestation.*** You can manifest specific parts of the armor individually. As a bonus action, you may spend 2 cursed energy per property to summon one of its features. However, you can only benefit from the hit points property if the full armor is active.

Partial Manifestation lasts for 1 minute. At the end of this duration, you can spend 1 cursed energy to extend it for an additional minute.

Below is an example of an armor you can create:

Insect Armor [Biological Classification: Insecta]: You have learned to create armor that mimics the efficiency of an insect’s exoskeleton. While Liquid Metal is active, you can use a bonus action and spend 10 cursed energy to envelop yourself in this armor, gaining the following benefits as long as it has hit points:

- Enhanced Physicality: Your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores each increase by 4, as do their maximums.
- Damage Resistance: You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- Flight: Wings sprout from your back, granting you a flying speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you can use your free action to Dash.
- Enhanced Strikes: Your unarmed strikes deal two additional damage dice. On a critical hit, your unarmed strikes roll one extra damage die.
- Destructive Force: You deal double damage to objects and structures.

## Cursed Speech feats
All of these feats require you to have the Cursed Speech cursed technique.

### Vocal Toughness
*`Prerequisite: 14+ Constitution`*

Your vocal cords have become exceptionally durable. 

Your vocal cord hit points are increased to half of your maximum hit points, rather than a third. At 10th level, this increases to your full maximum hit points.

## Cursed Spirit Manipulation feats
All of these feats require you to have the Cursed Spirit Manipulation cursed technique.

### Accepted Cycle
The cycle of exorcising and consuming curses is a painful one, and most minds cannot handle it. However, you have mastered this cycle and learned to accept it. You gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws to resist madness.
- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws when consuming curses.
- If you fail to meet the DC to absorb a creature, you can try again after a short or long rest.
- When consuming curses or resisting madness, you can roll a d4 and add it as a bonus to your Constitution and Wisdom saving throws. This bonus increases at higher levels: a d6 at 6th level, a d8 at 9th level, a d10 at 12th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

### Cursed Spirit Decoy
*`Prerequisites: 4th level`*

Through your experience, you've learned to adapt to the habits and routines of common cursed spirits, developing a method to find and hunt them efficiently for your arsenal. 

As part of a long rest, you spend 1 hour searching for weak cursed spirits and absorbing them. At the end of this period, roll a d6. The result indicates the number of random Grade 4 cursed spirits you successfully find and absorb during your search.

When you reach 11th level, you'll be able to find and absorb Grade 3 cursed spirits using this method. If you have the Cursed Energy Tracker feat, you can roll this d6 with advantage.

### Cursed Spirits Visions
*`Prerequisite: 8th level, must have Basic Barrier feat`*

You have learned to use the vision of your spirits as an extension of your own. 

When creating a barrier, or with no action required afterward while touching a barrier you’ve created, you can merge cursed spirits into the barrier, spending 2 cursed energy per spirit. Doing so grants the following benefits:

- The spirits track all creatures within the barrier, revealing their locations to you.
- When you merge spirits with the barrier, you gain +1 meter of blindsight for each cursed spirit merged, and you cannot be surprised while within the barrier.
- Your spirits cannot track Heavenly Restriction users, as they have no trace of cursed energy in their bodies, so this feat does not work against them.

Additionally, you can choose to project the vision of one of your spirits onto an object capable of generating or reflecting an image, such as a small mirror or a cellphone you possess.

### Swarms Master
*`Prerequisites: 4th level`*

Despite knowing how difficult it is to control multiple spirits at once, you've experimented and found ways to mitigate this challenge. 

When you create a swarm from a single type of cursed spirit (such as the Paralysis Curse), the swarm can utilize the curse’s unique traits, including special actions, reactions, or movement speeds like flight.

When the swarm uses any feature that deals damage, the damage or the damage dice are doubled. For every 10 additional spirits in the swarm, the damage increases again by the same amount. The damage can be increased this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. If the feature requires a saving throw, the target makes the save with disadvantage.

For any features that require Cursed Energy, the swarm will have an amount equal to what a single curse composing it would have and will spend the regular amount as needed.

## Disaster Plants feats
All of these feats require you to have the Disaster Plants cursed technique.

### Root Defender
*`Prerequisites: 8th level`*

You have mastered the use of roots to protect yourself. 

Whenever you are targeted by an attack roll or saving throw, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy as a reaction once per round to generate roots around you. 

While the roots are wrapped around you, you gain total cover, a burrowing speed equal to half your walking speed, and become incapacitated. 

These roots have hit points equal to 10 times your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). 

The technique ends when the roots' hit points are reduced to 0, and any remaining damage is dealt directly to you. 

You can end this effect at will, with no action required.

This feat counts as part of the Roots Extension technique.

## Disaster Tides feats
All of these feats require you to have the Disaster Tides cursed technique.

### Advanced Water Manipulator
*`Prerequisites: 4th level`*

Your mastery of water manipulation has grown to an incredible level, allowing you to create more unique techniques. 

You may choose an additional number of Water Manipulations equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). These must be selected from the Water Manipulations listed in the 3rd-level feature of Disaster Tides.

***Disastrous Water Bender.*** Your skill has continued to improve, enabling you to create more advanced techniques. Once you reach 8th level, you may choose an additional number of Advanced Water Manipulations equal to half your proficiency bonus plus 1. These must be selected from the Advanced Water Manipulations in the 6th-level feature of Disaster Tides.

***Supreme Aquakinesis.*** At 20th level, your control over your technique surpasses that of most others. You may switch your Supreme Manipulation option whenever you take a long rest.

## Ice Formation feats
All of these feats require you to have the Ice Formation cursed technique.

### Ice Hardener
*`Prerequisites: 12th level`*

You have learned to harden your ice by imbuing it with additional cursed energy when using your technique. 

Whenever you use your Lapse or Extension techniques, you can spend 4 cursed energy to harden your ice. The ice then gains the following benefits:

- Its hit points are equal to twice your Charisma modifier plus your jujutsu sorcerer level.
- It loses its vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, though it remains vulnerable to fire if you are not yet 20th level.
- Its AC is equal to your cursed energy DC plus your Charisma modifier.

This feat counts as an Extension technique.

## Idle Transfiguration feats
All of these feats require you to have the Idle Transfiguration cursed technique.

### Soul Manipulation Expert
*`Prerequisite: 8th level`*

You have learned new ways to manipulate people's souls and have become highly skilled in doing so.

***Cursed Awakening.*** As an action, you can spend 10 cursed energy to touch a willing human and alter their brain. The creature gains a number of levels in the Jujutsu Sorcerer class up to your proficiency bonus, while losing an equal number of levels in their previous class. If the creature has no levels, it gains one level instead. You can only use this ability once per creature and cannot target creatures of the Undead or Monstrosity type.

## Limitless feats
All of these feats require you to have the Limitless cursed technique.

### Hollow Purple
*`Prerequisites: 14th level, Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have learned to combine blue and red cursed energy, creating a purple bolt that destroys everything in its path. 

As a rooting distraction action, you begin concentrating as if concentrating on a spell. If you successfully maintain concentration until the beginning of your next turn, you can use an action and spend 20 Cursed Energy to release the attack. Every creature in a 5-meter-wide, 60-meter-long line must make a Dexterity saving throw at disadvantage. 

On a failure, they take 30d12 force damage. 

On a successful save, they take half damage and avoid the additional effects. 

Objects in the area that aren't worn or carried also take this damage. 

If this damage reduces a creature or object to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

This technique counts as an extension technique for the purposes of other features.

## Miracles feats
All of these feats require you to have the Miracles cursed technique.

### Innate Luck
*`Prerequisites: 4th level`*

Some have asked, "Are you lucky because miracles are by your side, or do you have miracles by your side because you're lucky?" The answer is clear: you are naturally lucky, and your technique simply reflects that in its effectiveness. 

When you roll dice for your cursed technique, you roll them twice and choose the better result. 

Additionally, you can make a miracles die roll its maximum value, but you can do so again only after completing a long rest.

## Mythical Beast Amber feats
All of these feats require you to have the Mythical Beast Amber cursed technique.

### Turn Up the Volume
*`Prerequisites: 8th level`*

The thrill of battling powerful opponents intensifies, causing you to overflow with electricity and killer intent.

Whenever you engage in a combat encounter against a creature whose level or CR is equal to or higher than your own, you can use your bonus action to enter a Ramped Up state for 10 Cursed Energy. This state lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier and provides the following benefits:

- You gain temporary cursed energy equal to your Charisma modifier, which lasts for the duration of the Ramped Up state. Additionally, if you have a feature that regenerates cursed energy, it will regenerate an additional amount equal to half its original value (rounded down, minimum +1), but only for this temporary cursed energy.
- Your Sparks feature can now be used twice per turn.
- If you have cursed energy armor, it provides 5 more temporary hit points per cursed energy spent.
- When you activate Ramped Up, and at the start of each turn you begin in this state, you gain a 3-meter bonus to your movement speed.

You can only enter the Ramped Up state once per long rest.

## Paralyzing Sight feats
All of these feats require you to have the Paralyzing Sight cursed technique.

### Eyes of a Medusa
*`Prerequisite: 14+ Constitution`*

Your eyes have become highly resilient, granting them greater durability. 

Your eye hit points are now equal to half of your maximum hit points, instead of one-third. 

At 10th level, this increases to your full maximum hit points.

## Private Pure Love Train feats
All of these feats require you to have the Private Pure Love Train cursed technique.

### The Fever
*`Prerequisites: Must have used Domain Expansion: Idle Death Gamble three times in a single combat encounter, must have landed Jackpot at least three times in a single combat encounter, 8th level`*

By continuously playing, gambling, and winning during battle, you occasionally enter a state of overwhelming euphoria known as the Fever, which makes hitting the Jackpot even more rewarding. 

Once per long rest, while in Normal Mode, you can use a Full Round Action to break the rules of the game and enter a different mode for your Domain by rolling a d20. On a result of 1-10, you enter Riichi Mode. On a result of 11-17, you enter Time-Saving Mode. On a result of 18-20, you enter Probability Change Mode.

Additionally, you gain the following benefits while in Probability Change Mode or Time-Saving Mode:

- **Feverish Probability Change Mode:** The first Shutter Door or Reserve Ball attack you make in this mode deals extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier. The creature you target with Shutter Door in Probability Change Mode also has disadvantage on its Dexterity saving throw against the attack. If you score a critical hit with a Reserve Ball attack in Probability Change Mode, the extra damage from this feature is not doubled, but it gains 1 additional damage die.

- **Feverish Time-Saving Mode:** The bonus equal to your proficiency bonus, which can be applied when rolling a Jackpot, can now either increase OR decrease the rolls of the 3d6, rather than just increasing. Additionally, whenever rolling for Events, the bonus from your attack’s color grants the number of rerolls the color provides, plus 2.

If you score a Jackpot while in either Probability Change Mode or Time-Saving Mode, you gain the following benefits instead of your normal Jackpot Bonus:

- You receive the effects of Improved Reverse Cursed Technique as if you had spent twice your level in cursed energy at the beginning of the round.
- Whenever you take damage, you may gain the benefits of Improved Reverse Cursed Technique as if you had spent a quarter of your level (rounded down) as a reaction. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your Charisma modifier (rounded down) while in this Jackpot Bonus.
- You receive cursed energy equal to twice your level plus twice your Charisma modifier at the beginning of your turns.
- Your hit points cannot be reduced below 1 for the duration of the Jackpot Bonus unless you would be killed outright. If an effect would kill you outright, you can attempt a DC 30 Charisma saving throw. On a success, you survive; on a failure, the effect kills you completely without a chance of survival. This can only be used once per long rest.
- You gain a +4 bonus to your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma scores, including their maximums, for the duration of the Jackpot Bonus.
- The maximum limit for any Cursed Energy Enhancement features you have is your proficiency bonus plus half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). Additionally, your Cursed Strike deals an extra die of damage, and Cursed Weapon Enhancement deals additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
- You can make a Shutter Door or Reserve Ball attack as part of the Attack action or an Attack of Opportunity reaction once per round. Additionally, when using your action or bonus action to perform a Shutter Door or Reserve Ball attack, you can expend 5 cursed energy instead of just 1 to make two Shutter Door or Reserve Ball attacks instead of one.
- You can use Consecutive Effect once while benefiting from this Jackpot Bonus, even if you are not in Domain Expansion: Idle Death Gamble.

## Teleportation feats
All of these feats require you to have the Teleportation cursed technique.

### Soul Swap
*`Prerequisite: 8th level`*

Through creative thinking, you've discovered a unique way to use your technique—swapping the souls of creatures. 

As an action, with two willing creatures both within 5 meters of you, you may swap their souls. For the duration of the swap, which lasts 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), all of their game statistics are swapped except for their mental stats (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma), any non-body or non-background feats, and their sorcerer path, if they have one. 

When the swap ends, both creatures return to their original bodies, reverting their game statistics, but each creature may ignore the prerequisites of any feats the other creature used while in their body—except for prerequisites that require you to be a certain race, have a specific cursed technique, or belong to a particular class. 

A creature may only be swapped twice within a one-month period; after that, you must wait another month before swapping that creature again.

## Ten Shadows Technique feats
All of these feats require you to have the Ten Shadow Technique cursed technique.

### Complete Totality
*`Prerequisite: 10th level`*

You have mastered control over your technique and its intricacies, allowing you to use Totality to create a new, more powerful shikigami. 

From now on, you can create Totalities from your shikigami without the need for them to die first. 

Additionally, you can create a special Totality called Chimera Beast Agito, which is composed of four of your shikigami instead of two. To do so, you follow the regular rules for making a Totality, selecting one shikigami as the base while the other three are treated as if they had previously died for the purpose of the Totality rules. 

You can only create one Chimera Beast Agito.

### Mastery of General
*`Prerequisite: 16th level, Mahoraga tamed through trial`*

You have learned to better utilize the greatest triumph of the strongest shikigami ever seen. 

As an action, you can spend 5 Cursed Energy to place the Eight-Handled Wheel on your head for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier. 

If the creature with the wheel on its head starts taking damage, the wheel will begin to adapt as described in the Eight-Handled Wheel. 

If Mahoraga is summoned or pulled from Shadow Storage, it will continue the adaptation process, and if all four turns have been completed, he will become fully adapted.

Additionally, if you are a Cursed Vessel with the Completed Vessel subrace and have Mahoraga under your control, you can use the Eight-Handled Wheel on the soul of the creature you possess.

Lastly, if you are incapacitated, you can summon or pull Mahoraga from Shadow Storage without spending an action, by spending the normal amount of required Cursed Energy. In doing so, you control him directly instead of commanding him (no action required) as long as you remain incapacitated.

### Technique Materialization
*`Prerequisites: Nue or Max Elephant tamed through trial`*

You have learned to manifest the powers of certain shadows by channeling cursed energy. While the respective shadow is not summoned, you can use its technique materialization.

***Lightning Powers.*** As an action, you can spend 5 cursed energy to use the Lightning Charge action.

***Water Ejection.*** As an action, you can spend 6 cursed energy to use either the Water Spray or Water Cannon actions.

These techniques are affected by Stronger Shadows and Totality. You must have the respective shadow tamed in order to use its technique materialization, and the shadow must not be summoned in any form, including Totality.

At 11th level, you learn to enhance the powers of your shadows with Jujutsu.

***Lightning Ray.*** As an action, you can spend 10 cursed energy to make a cursed energy attack roll against a creature within 20 meters. On a hit, the creature takes lightning damage equal to the Lightning Discharge damage die, increased by a number of dice equal to your Charisma modifier.

***Pressurized Beam.*** As an action, you can spend 12 cursed energy to force all creatures in a 1-meter-wide, 40-meter-long line to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take the Water Cannon damage die, increased by a number of dice equal to your Charisma modifier, in piercing damage. On a success, they take half as much damage.

When using a materialization, you can apply Shikigami Output to the respective shikigami as if you were summoning it, increasing the dice of its respective technique and adding Stronger Shadows counters as well.

## Tool Manipulation feats
All of these feats require you to have the Tool Manipulation cursed technique.

### Heavy Lifter
*`Prerequisites: 12th level`*

You have become highly skilled at carrying heavy weights through the telekinetic bond you share with your tools. 

The amount of weight you can carry is increased to 90 times your Charisma modifier in kg (minimum of 1 kg).
