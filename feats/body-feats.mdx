## 50 Meters in 3 Seconds!
*`Prerequisites: 15+ Dexterity`*

You possess an innate speed advantage over others of your kind or have intensely trained your agility.

You gain the following benefits:

- Your Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Your movement speed increases by 5 meters.
- You have two reactions instead of one per round of combat.

## Advanced Regeneration
*`Prerequisite: Regeneration feat`*

Your regenerative abilities surpass those of most curses, rivaling even Reverse Cursed Energy.

You now regain 15 hit points for every 1 Cursed Energy spent.

Additionally, if you are a Special Grade Cursed Spirit, every 10 hit points healed restores one of your limbs by one damage stage, regardless of how much health it would have normally recovered.

## Air Jump
*`Prerequisites: 18+ Strength or 18+ Dexterity, Cursed Energy Reinforcement feature or must be a 16th level Heavenly Restriction`*

You have mastered using Cursed Energy to propel yourself into the air, giving you the ability to jump almost as if you were flying.

You gain the following benefits:

- Whenever you take fall damage, you can use your reaction and spend Cursed Energy or Stamina points up to double your Strength, Dexterity, or Charisma modifier to reduce the damage by that amount times 5.
- On your turn, while in the air, you can spend Cursed Energy (up to double your Charisma modifier) to perform a number of high or long jumps equal to the amount of Cursed Energy spent until the start of your next turn. If you have Heavenly Restriction, you may instead spend Stamina (up to your Strength or Dexterity modifier) to perform a number of high or long jumps equal to half the amount of Stamina spent (rounded down) until the start of your next turn. This jump counts as though you had a running start.

## Athlete History
*`Prerequisites: 15+ Strength`*

You were born with unnatural strength, capable of destroying walls with sheer brute force.

You gain the following benefits:

- Your Strength score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Your unarmed strike damage die increases by 2 tiers (1 -> d4 -> d6 -> d8 -> etc.).
- You may use your Strength modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier when calculating your AC through Unarmored Defense or Supernatural Resilience.

## Cursed Biology
*`Prerequisites: Must be a Cursed Spirit, 12th level or be an Imaginary Vengeful Cursed Spirit`*

Cursed Spirits already display strange and specialized biology, but yours is on an entirely different level. Work with your DM to determine a unique feature of your body that either allows you to do something completely new or enhances an existing ability. This feature should be closely related to your character or technique, reflecting something iconic about you. For example, Dagon, a Womb, had a black orb in place of their stomach that they could draw a sigil on to expand a domain, enabling them to do so without hands and more quickly than usual.

If you are an Imaginary Vengeful Cursed Spirit without the Evolution feat, these unique bodily features become even more powerful, drawing on the concept from which you were born and your technique. You may have two features instead of one, with one focused on a central power related to your concept and the other enhancing your technique. An example is Hanami, whose outer shell and roots grant enhanced endurance but with a weak point, and her flower arm, which interacts with her technique and presumably enhances her Radiant Beam.

If you possess the Special Grade background feat, you gain two features as though you were an Imaginary Vengeful Cursed Spirit. However, if you are an Imaginary Vengeful Cursed Spirit with the Special Grade background feat and without the Evolution feat, you may gain any number of features allowed by your DM, with a minimum of 3. These features must be centered around your concept and/or technique and can possess extreme power. An example is Kurorushi, who can summon, control, and enhance countless cockroaches to the point where they can battle with Special Grade sorcerers, and his ability to create clones and reincarnate into them by having his cockroaches consume flesh.

## Colossal Physique
*`Prerequisites: 17+ Strength, Athlete History feat`*

The strength you possess is now on par with experts in cursed reinforcement or massive cursed spirits and shikigami.

You gain the following benefits:

- You count as two sizes larger for the purposes of grappling, shoving, disarming, and the weight you can carry, push, drag, or lift.
- Your unarmed strike damage die increases by 1 tier (d8 -> d10 -> d12 -> etc.).
- You become proficient in the Athletics skill if you were not already proficient. If you were already proficient, you gain expertise in Athletics. If you already have expertise, you can add your proficiency bonus to all Strength checks you make.
- Any attack roll you make that uses Strength deals twice as much damage to objects and structures. This may use Charisma if you have Cursed Energy Reinforcement.
- You have learned to put your weight behind an attack, launching an opponent a considerable distance. Once per turn, as part of a successful melee attack, you can force the creature hit to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failure, they are knocked directly back a number of meters equal to your Strength modifier times 3. If the creature collides with an unsecured object or structure, both the creature and the unsecured object or structure take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 3 meters the creature had left to travel after colliding. If the target is another creature, both take damage equal to half of your damage roll (rounded down). If your attack is a critical hit, the creature automatically fails their saving throw and is knocked back twice the distance.
- Whenever you make a Strength check or saving throw, you can give yourself advantage on the roll. You can do this a number of times equal to your Strength modifier, regaining all uses after a long rest. This may use Charisma if you have Cursed Energy Reinforcement.

## Evolution
*`Prerequisite: Must be a Cursed Spirit with the Cursed Womb Template, 12th level, have failed two death saving throws in the same fight, or experienced severe psychological trauma (as determined by the DM).`*

Through significant trauma, you have evolved into a new and improved version of yourself. You gain a +2 bonus to any ability score of your choice, including its maximum, and you can select three additional benefits from the following list:

- Your movement speed doubles.
- You can now add your proficiency bonus to all damage rolls.
- As a free action, you may gain a flying (hover) speed equal to your movement speed until the end of your next turn.
- Your Cursed Energy maximum increases by double your Charisma modifier.
    You gain 3 additional points to spend on the Body Functions List.

Your DM may grant you the Special Grade Cursed Spirit status after evolving if they believe you are powerful enough. If you possess the Special Grade background feat, or are granted Special Grade status upon becoming a Cursed Spirit through the A Curse Upon Death variant rule, you gain the following additional benefits upon evolving:

- You gain the Cursed Biology feat, but it must be a minor feature, such as Dagon's stomach.
- If you already possessed the Cursed Biology feat, it becomes an enhanced version, and you gain a secondary and tertiary biological feature, such as Naoya’s air vents, string limbs, and shell.
- If you have the Innate Domain feat or an Incomplete Domain, you gain a Complete Domain.

## Human Wall
*`Prerequisites: 17+ Constitution, Strong Body feat`*

Your endurance is beyond human limits—no matter what, you refuse to fall on the battlefield.

You gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws.
- Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to three times your level. Whenever you gain a level, your hit point maximum increases by an additional 3.
- When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to expend a hit die, regaining hit points equal to the amount rolled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, regaining all expended uses on a long rest. If you have Cursed Energy Reinforcement, you may use Charisma instead of Constitution for this feature.

## Improved Body Functions
*`Prerequisite: Must be a Cursed Spirit, 15+ Strength or 15+ Dexterity or 15+ Constitution`*

Your biology is an anomaly, even by the already unusual standards of Cursed Spirits.

You gain the following benefits:

- Your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score increases by 1 (to a maximum of 20).
- You gain two uses of the Hard to Kill racial feature per long rest, and it can now be used against radiant damage as well as other damage types.
- You gain 4 points to spend on options from the Body Functions List.
- You reduce all radiant damage you take by half your character level (rounded down) plus your proficiency bonus (minimum of 1).

If you have the Special Grade background feat or are granted Special Grade status immediately upon becoming a Cursed Spirit (via the A Curse Upon Death variant rule), the benefits instead become:

- Your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score increases by 2, or two of these scores increase by 1 (to a maximum of 20).
- You gain two uses of the Hard to Kill racial feature, with the second use recharging after a short rest. Both uses can be applied to radiant damage as well as other damage types.
- You gain 5 points to spend on options from the Body Functions List.
- You reduce all radiant damage you take by half your character level (rounded down) plus your proficiency bonus twice (minimum of 1).

## Immense Stamina
*`Prerequisites: 14+ Constitution, must be a Heavenly Restriction`*

Your body has vast stamina reserves, turning you into a stamina powerhouse.

You gain the following benefits:

- Your Constitution score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You add your Constitution modifier an additional time when determining your Stamina.

## Overflowing Stamina Reserves
*`Prerequisites: 17+ Constitution, Immense Stamina feat, must be a Heavenly Restriction`*

Your Stamina reserves are so vast they seem nearly endless, allowing you to perform incredible physical feats long after others have exhausted their energy.

You gain the following benefits:

- Your Constitution score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You add your Constitution modifier an additional time when determining your Stamina.

## Regeneration
*`Prerequisites: Must be a Cursed Spirit, 16+ Charisma`*

With a body composed entirely of Cursed Energy, you can mend your wounds with ease.

As a bonus action by expending Cursed Energy, or as a reaction when you take damage, you can regenerate hit points. For every 1 Cursed Energy spent, you regain 5 hit points. Additionally, if you are suffering from a physical condition such as a concussion or a similar affliction, you can remove one such effect for every 5 hit points restored through this feature.

You cannot use this feature until the start of your next turn after taking radiant damage.

The maximum amount of Cursed Energy you can spend on this feature at once is equal to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus. Special Grade Cursed Spirits have no limit on the amount of Cursed Energy they can expend for regeneration.

## Reinforced Immune System
*`Prerequisites: 15+ Constitution`*

Your immune system is naturally superior to that of your peers, or prolonged exposure to dangerous foreign elements has significantly strengthened it.

You gain the following benefits:

- Your Constitution score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You have advantage on saving throws against the poisoned condition and resistance to poison damage.
- You gain proficiency in death saving throws.

## Resilient
*`Prerequisite: 15+ Constitution`*

Your resilience is exceptional, allowing you to endure far more than the average sorcerer over prolonged battles.

All of your Hit Dice increase in size by one step (e.g., d6 to d8, d8 to d10, etc.), up to a maximum of d12. As a result, your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your level + 1. Whenever you gain Hit Dice and hit points after acquiring this feat, your newly gained Hit Die is treated as one step larger.

You can take this feat multiple times, but no Hit Die can exceed d12.

<Note>
	The calculation should assume you had the increased Hit Die from level 1. 
	
	If your hit points exceed what they would be under that assumption, you’ve miscalculated (e.g., increasing initial hit points per level or adding extra HP beyond level × 1 + 1).
</Note>

|Normal Hit Dice|Enhanced Hit Dice|
|:-:|:-:|
|d4|d6|
|d6|d8|
|d8|d10|
|d10|d12|
|d12|d12|
	
## Strong Body
*`Prerequisite: 15+ Constitution`*

Your exceptional durability makes taking you down a difficult task.

You gain the following benefits:

- Your Constitution score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When calculating hit points gained per level, you add your Constitution modifier twice.
- You reduce all damage you take, except for psychic or thunder damage, by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier. This reduction does not apply to attacks using Cursed Energy or magic unless you are under the effects of Cursed Energy Armor.

## Surreal Mindset
*`Prerequisite: 3rd level, must be a Heavenly Restriction`*

You have refined the way you utilize your Heavenly Body to near perfection. You gain two Uncanny Mindsets, and gaining these does not count toward your Body Points.

You can take this feat multiple times.

## Untraceable Speed
*`Prerequisites: 17+ Dexterity, 50 Meters in 3 Seconds! feat`*

Even by the supernatural standards of the Jujutsu world, your agility makes you as fearsome as any other sorcerer.

You gain the following benefits:

- If an action or feature increases any of your speeds, that speed is further increased by a number of meters equal to 2 times your Dexterity modifier (minimum of 1 meter). If you have Cursed Energy Reinforcement, you may use Charisma instead of Dexterity for this calculation.
- You gain proficiency in one Dexterity skill of your choice, or expertise if you are already proficient. Additionally, you can add half your proficiency bonus to all Dexterity checks you make that you are not already proficient in.
- You can take the Dash action or make a skill check you are proficient in as a bonus action.
- As a reaction to passing a saving throw or when an attack roll is made against you, you may move up to half your speed in a direction of your choice. This movement cannot be used to exit Domains. If this movement would take you out of the area targeted by an attack roll, you may roll an Acrobatics check contested against the attack roll. If your Acrobatics check exceeds the attack roll, the attack automatically misses, regardless of your Armor Class. On a failure, the attack proceeds as normal, though you still move as intended. This roll automatically fails against a critical hit unless you are at least 10 levels higher than the attacker (or 10 CR higher if they do not have a level). If you fail this roll by no more than 3 against an attack targeting a specific limb (when using the Limb System), you may change which limb is targeted. If you are reacting to a saving throw and move out of the area of effect, you are unaffected by it.
- When a creature moves into your melee range, or you move into the melee range of a creature, you may make one melee attack as a reaction. You can use this ability only once per creature per round.

## Upgraded Storage
*`Prerequisite: Must be a Cursed Corpse, 12th level, must not be taken via a modification`*

Your body has adapted, allowing it to accept more modifications. Your modification limit increases to double your proficiency bonus, and this increases to triple your proficiency bonus at 17th level.

For the purposes of ability modifications, your maximum ability score is increased by your proficiency bonus.
