## Battle Veteran
*`Prerequisites: Weapon Master sorcerer path, 12+ Wisdom, 10th level`*

You have fought in numerous battles and have become highly skilled at learning from each encounter. 

You gain 4 Secret Techniques, with an additional technique granted at 13th and 17th levels.

## Cursed Weapon Wielder
*`Prerequisites: 18+ Strength or 18+ Dexterity, Cursed Weapon Enhancement feature or the ability to reduce a creature to 0 hit points with three different types of weapons, 8th level`*

Your expertise with all forms of weaponry has made you a perfect candidate for wielding cursed tools that carry greater status and power.

You gain the following benefits:

- Any weapon attack using a Cursed Tool increases its critical hit range by 1 (for example, a Semi-Grade Cursed Katana, which normally scores a critical hit on a roll of 20, would now score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20). 
- If you roll a natural 20 on an attack with a Cursed Tool, you can make one additional weapon attack with advantage as part of your turn using the same Cursed Tool that scored the critical hit. This additional attack cannot trigger another extra attack from rolling a natural 20 on the attack roll. 
- You may ignore one property of a weapon you are currently wielding. If the weapon has a Special property, you may ignore it and increase the weaponâ€™s damage die by one tier (for example, from 0 to 1d4, 1d4 to 1d6, and so on).
