## Blessed by The Sparks
You've always been lucky, and it's helped you get through many challenges in life. You have been blessed by the sparks of the Black Flash. 

Upon gaining the Black Flash cursed feat, you can land Black Flashes more reliably. 

As a bonus action, you can begin concentrating. While concentrating, your next melee attack will be a guaranteed Black Flash, after which the concentration ends. 

If you take damage or your concentration is disturbed, you must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw to maintain it. You can only concentrate in this way if you are below half your maximum hit points while fighting an opponent with a CR or level higher than yours, or if you’ve been engaged in combat for 5 rounds or more. 

If you are fighting an opponent with a CR or level 5 or more higher than yours, you do not need to be below half your maximum hit points. After concentrating in this way, you cannot begin concentrating again until the end of your next turn.

<Note>
	For DMs: You may allow a character with this feat to start concentrating even without meeting the stated requirements if you feel the moment is narratively appropriate.
</Note>

Additionally, if you do not gain the Black Flash cursed feat by level 4, you automatically gain it.

## Blessing of the Twin
*`Prerequisites: Must be Human`*

While still in the womb, due to unknown circumstances, you consumed your twin. This event has left you with an abnormal body, having absorbed your twin’s essence. 

You now have four arms, two faces, and two mouths—one normal, the other located on your stomach.

Your body has transformed, evolving into a form perfectly suited for sorcery. Your size increases by one category, up to a maximum of Large. You gain advantage on Intimidation checks, and your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 2. The extra pair of eyes you possess allows you to make Perception checks with advantage.

Additionally, your two extra arms below your original ones, along with the mouth on your stomach, are fully functional and can act independently of your original limbs, granting you the following benefits:

- You gain an additional bonus action on your turn. You may use this extra bonus action to grapple or shove a creature.
- When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make an additional attack as part of the action. This extra attack can only be a melee attack or a cursed technique feature that replaces an attack.
- When using your cursed technique, you can reduce its action cost by 1 (e.g., Full Round Action → Action → Bonus Action → Free Action). If this reduction applies to a reaction, you gain 1 additional reaction for that round, but you may only gain this extra reaction once per round per feature.

Furthermore, you can ignore one prerequisite for the Chanting Cursed feat, excluding the level requirement. Due to your mastery of this form and its synergy with chanting, chanting becomes a free action for you, while complex chanting now takes an action.

## Cursed Energy Heavenly Restriction
*`Prerequisites: Cannot be a Heavenly Restriction or a Cursed Corpse`*

You were cursed, or perhaps blessed, with a fragile body but immense cursed energy output and range. 

There are three tiers of severity for this Heavenly Restriction: light, medium, and major. You only gain the benefits of the tier you choose. For instance, if you select a medium severity for your right arm, you will not receive the benefits of a light severity right arm. You can choose the ear, arm, leg, and eye options twice.

Below are the tables for the light, medium, and major severities you can choose. The number in the Benefits column is added to the limit of how much cursed energy you can spend when you use cursed energy.

<Note>
	You may collaborate with your DM to create additional detriments or benefits, such as for internal organs, and to increase your maximum cursed energy.
</Note>

***Increased Reach.*** Due to your Heavenly Restriction, your cursed energy reach has expanded. For each detriment this feat grants you, the range of your cursed energy features that are not touch range increases by 10 km if the severity is minor, 20 km if medium, and 30 km if major. This feature does not apply to barriers. It only affects ranges of abilities that do not originate from your body, such as summoning or controlling a creature, and requires you to somehow know the location—whether by seeing it, possibly through a summoned creature's eyes, or knowing the exact coordinates through knowledge or cursed energy sensing.

Finally, as a binding placed on the body you were born with, you lose this feat if you are not in the body you were born with.

## Cursed Partner
*`Prerequisites: Must be human`*

Due to a traumatic event in your past, a loved one now haunts you. Unable to cope with their death, they have returned as a curse.

You are bound to a Vengeful Spirit at all times. However, for the most part, it remains dormant and in a non-physical state.

***Innate Technique.*** If your Vengeful Spirit possessed an Innate Technique in life, even if it was not a sorcerer, it will retain it as a spirit. Work with your DM to determine the innate technique and the spirit's level for using it.

Your spirit has two forms when it is not dormant:

***Partially Manifested.*** In this form, the spirit has a physical presence that is partly a shadowy image, and it is not at full power. It takes double damage from all sources, deals half damage (rounded down), and cannot use its Innate Technique, if it possesses one. Your spirit can manifest partially in the following ways:

***Danger Manifestation.*** Being a sorcerer is stressful, filled with danger and trouble. When these dangerous times come, your Vengeful Spirit may manifest into the physical world.

Whenever you take damage from a single instance that exceeds your Jujutsu Sorcerer level + twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2), or face hostility, you must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. This damage must reduce your hit points, ignoring any temporary hit points.

On a success, you control yourself and prevent the spirit from manifesting. On a failure, your Vengeful Spirit partially manifests to protect you.

At 11th level, you no longer need to make the Wisdom saving throw. You can call upon your spirit to appear in its partially manifested form as a bonus action for 4 cursed energy, appearing within 3 meters of you. You can summon the spirit a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), regaining all uses after a long rest.

If your spirit is reduced to 0 hit points in its partially manifested form, it is desummoned and returns to its dormant state. You may summon it again, regaining 1 hit point when it is summoned.

***Fully Manifested.*** In this form, the spirit is at its full power and can act with its full might.

To fully manifest the spirit, you must directly call on it and channel its curse. As an action for 10 cursed energy, make a DC 25 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, nothing happens. On a success, your spirit fully manifests, appearing within 3 meters of you. If you have the Freed Spirit feat, your spirit can remain fully manifested for a maximum of five minutes a day, after which it cannot fully manifest again until you complete a long rest.

As long as the curse that binds you and your spirit persists, your spirit cannot be exorcised. If it is reduced to 0 hit points or killed, it will regain 1 hit point and become stable, returning to its dormant state. It cannot manifest again in any way until you complete a long rest, including additional abilities like Vengeful Spirit Protection.

If you die or the curse is broken, your spirit can be exorcised.

Regardless of the form the curse takes, it will act as follows:

The spirit prioritizes your safety and is in a Berserk state. It remains berserk even if it cannot see a target. The spirit acts on the same turn as you, is charmed by you (ignoring immunity to the condition), and follows your orders as long as they do not contradict the Berserk state.

As a free action, you can make a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check against the spirit. On a success, it will stop attacking and return to its dormant state. On a failure, it will continue attacking until no other creatures are in sight.

***Spirit Persuasion.*** At 5th level, your control over the curse improves. The Charisma (Persuasion) check required is reduced to 15.

***Spirit Extensions.*** At 6th level, if you use the Extension technique variant rule, you can now create extensions that use your vengeful curse. If your spirit has an innate technique, you cannot create extensions that directly combine your innate technique with its own.

***Tamer Spirit.*** At 11th level, you gain more control over your cursed spirit. The spirit becomes Bloodlusted against creatures showing hostility toward you, instead of Berserk. It will follow your orders as long as they do not contradict the Bloodlusted condition.

***Tamed Spirit.*** At 17th level, your spirit fully obeys you. You can desummon your spirit as a reaction to being attacked, and it will obey your orders, even if they contradict the Bloodlusted condition.

***Conduit.*** A curse is most stable when possessing an item. Determine an item or medium that was significant between you and your spirit in life. This item serves as a conduit for controlling the curse.

While you possess the conduit, you can more easily manifest your vengeful spirit. Summon it fully for 4 cursed energy instead of 10, and you automatically succeed on the Charisma saving throw.

If you have Cursed Weapon Enhancement, when using it while possessing the conduit, you may use your vengeful spirit’s cursed energy instead. If your spirit can spend more cursed energy on the enhancement than you can, you may spend that amount instead.

As you grow in power, you may discover new ways to use your spirit's energy through the conduit. Work with your DM to explore how you can utilize your vengeful spirit’s cursed energy.

***Vengeful Spirit Strike.*** Once per round, no action required, you can call upon your spirit to aid you in combat by spending 1 cursed energy. Make a melee cursed energy attack roll against a creature within 3 meters. This attack deals slashing damage equal to the damage die of the weapon you are wielding. If you are unarmed, the damage equals your unarmed strike or martial arts damage (whichever is higher). This cannot be used while your spirit is fully or partially manifested.

***Vengeful Spirit Protection.*** As a reaction to a melee attack roll for 1 cursed energy, your spirit can manifest to protect you, granting +2 to your AC for the attack. This cannot be used while your spirit is fully manifested. If the spirit is partially manifested, it must spend its movement to get in front of you to protect you.

At 14th level, your spirit gains the Cursed Biology feat.

<Note>
	Curses are twisted and unpredictable, often taking various forms. Your DM can make your vengeful spirit much stronger at lower levels, front-loading its power. This can be done by increasing the spirit's ability scores or Challenge Rating or by making you count as a higher-level Jujutsu Sorcerer than you are. For example, Vengeful Spirit Rika Orimoto is much stronger than she would normally be when her master, Yuta Okkotsu, has only 1 level in the Jujutsu Sorcerer class.
</Note>

## Humanoid Prison
*`Prerequisites: Must be Human, Must not have a Heavenly Restriction`*

<Note>
	Even though this feat requires you to "be Human," if you become a Living Vessel for this feat, you still count as Human.
</Note>

Your constitution is remarkable, allowing you to consume Cursed Objects with little to no affliction, a trait so rare it occurs in humans once every 1000 years. 

You have advantage on all checks and saving throws to resist the effects of Cursed Objects you consume, and the DC of these effects is reduced by your proficiency bonus + Constitution modifier.

If you fail a saving throw when consuming a Cursed Object, you instead spit it out within 1 meter of you, avoiding the normal effects of the Cursed Object. If the effect would kill you, you not only spit the object out, but you are also knocked unconscious.

Additionally, you gain the [Strong Body]() feat.

A Cursed Object you consume cannot force your body to submit unless a Binding Vow has been made between you and the object. If you consume more Cursed Objects than your level + Constitution modifier, you must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid possession.

As an action, you can “switch” with a Cursed Object you’ve consumed, temporarily granting it control of your body. At any time, as a reaction, you can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a success, you regain control, while on a failure, you cannot take control back for 1 minute. The DC increases by 1 for each successful saving throw and decreases by 1 for each failure. The DC resets to its original value after a Long Rest.

## Intertwined Destinies
*`Prerequisites: Must be human and have a monozygotic twin`*

Your bond with your twin goes beyond blood; it is a connection forged by fate. Together, you are treated as one by your cursed technique. Being born in this manner limits the potential of both you and your twin. Twins connected in this way have two options:

***Jujutsu Sorcerer.*** One twin can gain levels in the Jujutsu Sorcerer class and possess a cursed technique. However, their cursed energy will be equal to their Jujutsu Sorcerer level + half of their Charisma modifier (rounded down). Additionally, any feats that would increase cursed energy only increase it by half (rounded down). Both twins can be sorcerers, but only one can have a technique, and both will have reduced cursed energy.

***Heavenly Restriction.*** The other twin can gain levels in the Heavenly Restriction class but will not gain the Restrained Body, Semi-Awakened Body, Heavenly Undetection, or Awakened Body features. This is because they share the other half of the cursed energy, preventing them from fully utilizing their restriction. However, they gain one Body feat, as their body remains superior to the average human’s.

If one twin dies, they may choose to pass on the limits to the other. If the sorcerer twin dies, they can transfer their innate technique and cursed energy, allowing the surviving twin to gain the missing features from their Heavenly Restriction. If the restricted twin dies, they can transfer their cursed energy to the sorcerer twin, removing the limit on their cursed energy. If both twins are sorcerers, the surviving twin will gain the technique if they did not already have it and will possess normal cursed energy.

## Jujutsu Genius
*`Prerequisite: Must have two Ability Scores of 15+ or higher, one of which is Charisma`*

<Note>
	This feature is extremely powerful, so take extreme care when granting this to a player.
</Note>

Your potential is virtually limitless, even when compared to other extraordinary Jujutsu Sorcerers or Cursed Spirits. You gain the following benefits:

***Endless Possibilities.*** One prerequisite for a feat or cursed feat may be ignored by you. You cannot ignore prerequisites that require you to have another cursed feat, be a specific race, possess a particular innate technique, be a specific class, meet body feat requirements, or be a certain level to obtain them. For example, you can't pick the Reverse Cursed Technique if you are a Cursed Spirit.

***Skilled.*** Your skillset is diverse and unorthodox. At 1st level, you do not gain your class's skill proficiencies. Instead, you gain four skill proficiencies of your choice. At 14th level, you can select one skill of your choice to become proficient in and choose two skills you were already proficient in to gain expertise in.

***Exemplary Student.*** You seamlessly acquire additional abilities that other sorcerers train tirelessly for. At 7th level, you gain two cursed feats of your choice from the Sorcerer Training feature, ignoring their requirements. At 14th level, you gain two Barrier Technique feats of your choice, ignoring their requirements (you cannot select the Domain Expansion feat from this feature).

***Vow Crafter.*** You gain the Binding Vow feature, but your limit starts at 1. When you would gain the Binding Vow class feature at 5th level, the number of Binding Vows you can possess becomes 1 + your Intelligence modifier + half of your proficiency bonus, rounded down (minimum of 2). If you have the Vows Master cursed feat, the number of Binding Vows you can possess becomes 2 + twice your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus (minimum of 4).

***Jujutsu Pinnacle.*** If you have a Cursed Technique, you begin with 10 refinement points toward your Domain Expansion. If you are in combat against a hostile creature with a level or CR equal to your own or higher and you survive, you gain refinement points equal to twice your Charisma modifier. The maximum number of refinement points you can gain from this feature is 250 if you do not already have a Domain Expansion or possess either the Incomplete Domain, Domain Expansion, or Non-Lethal Domain Expansion feats. Even if you meet these requirements, you cannot gain more than 500 refinement points from this feature. If you have a Sorcerer Path, you begin with 5 refinement points toward a Simple Domain. All methods of refining your Simple Domain provide additional refinement points equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded down.

## Natural Sorcerer
*`Prerequisites: Must not have a Heavenly Restriction`*

Whether due to your ancestry or simply being born with it, your cursed energy reserves are naturally immense. 

When calculating your maximum cursed energy, you add your Jujutsu Sorcerer level twice, plus your proficiency bonus twice.

## Otherworldly Body
You were born with an extraordinarily powerful body for various reasons, such as being artificially created by a powerful sorcerer for a greater purpose. This trait has enhanced your body to withstand attacks from all sources. 

Whenever you gain a level in your class, your hit point maximum increases by 5. You can also choose one physical ability score to increase its maximum to 22, and that score will increase by 1 with each level. 

Additionally, your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores each increase by 1, up to their respective maximums.

- If you chose Strength as your 22 stat, you gain the [50 Meters in 3 Seconds!]() and [Reinforced Immune System]() feats.

- If you chose Dexterity as your 22 stat, you gain the [Athlete History]() and [Reinforced Immune System]() feats.

- If you chose Constitution as your 22 stat, you gain the [Athlete History]() and [50 Meters in 3 Seconds!]() feats.

You also gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws.

## Six Eyes
*`Prerequisite: Must have the Sorcerer Family Member background and be in the Gojo Clan, must be a Human, and there must be a Star Plasma Vessel in the world`*

<Note>
	This feature can be granted to only one creature per campaign. It is extremely powerful, so take **extreme** care when handing this out to a player.
</Note>

You have been granted the extraordinary and rare gift of the Six Eyes, a power exclusive to the strongest members of the Gojo Clan. With this ability, your capabilities as a Jujutsu Sorcerer increase immensely. You gain the following benefits:

***Illuminated Vision.*** You gain 20 meters of Truesight. You also suffer no penalties when seeing through thin, light, and non-rigid objects (such as a blindfold, towel, or scarf), allowing you to use these objects to protect your eyes from the overwhelming amount of information your eyes process.

At 14th level, you can spend 6 Cursed Energy as a bonus action to expand your Truesight range to 40 meters for 1 minute in initiative, or for 1 hour out of initiative.

***Information Overload.*** Due to the sheer amount of information your eyes capture, you must wear eye protection or suffer from an information overload. If you are not wearing eye protection, you gain 1 level of exhaustion every minute, up to a maximum of 3 levels. Additionally, for each level of exhaustion you gain, the damage die tier of your techniques decreases by 1, and the DC of your techniques suffers a penalty of -1.

If you wear eye protection again, this timer resets after 1 minute of covering your eyes. Outside of combat, you gain 1 level of exhaustion every hour your eyes are uncovered, with the timer and exhaustion resetting after wearing eye protection for 10 minutes.
Additionally, if you have the Improved Reverse Cursed Technique feat, you can remove these exhaustion levels by healing for 50 hit points with the feat, even if you have not taken damage.

***Cursed Energy Economy.*** The Six Eyes dramatically reduce the amount of cursed energy you use for techniques. You gain the Flawless Fundamentals feat, ignoring its requirements. Additionally, all cursed energy categories are reduced without needing specific output feats. While wearing eye protection, this reduction is further decreased by your proficiency bonus (i.e., proficiency bonus fewer energy spent).

***Infinity Optimization.*** Due to the Six Eyes' innate nature, it enhances the efficiency of the Infinity technique. If you obtain the Reverse Cursed Technique feat, you can improve Infinity's efficiency. Once per month during a long rest, you may make a DC 20 Arcana check. On a failure, nothing happens and you lose an amount of cursed energy equal to Infinity's cursed energy cost, which cannot be regained until your next long rest. On a success, you gain 1 Infinity Optimization counter.

You need 12 Infinity Optimization counters to unlock the Infinity Optimization feature, which removes the need to use reactions or spend cursed energy to nullify attacks with Infinity.

***Amazing Student, Terrible Teacher.*** You have disadvantage on any rolls related to teaching something to another creature. However, you have advantage on any rolls related to learning something new.

***Perceptive Eyes.*** Nothing escapes your attention. You gain expertise in Perception, have advantage on all Perception checks, and add your Charisma modifier to Perception checks. Additionally, you gain the Cursed Energy Tracker feat. While using this feat, you can detect cursed energy remains in a 80-meter radius, even if you cannot see it directly. While wearing eye protection, you lose advantage on all perception checks.

***Potential Realization.*** Your ability to manipulate and visualize cursed energy is virtually perfect, allowing you to bring out the maximum potential of your cursed techniques. You automatically gain any Cursed Technique feats you meet the prerequisites for.

***Technique Reader.*** With a simple glance, you can instantly identify the capabilities of an enemy’s techniques. As a free action against a creature within your Truesight, you can learn the following information about them:

- Their Jujutsu Sorcerer or spellcasting class level.
- The spells they currently have prepared.
- The amount of cursed energy they possess.
- Whether they have Unique Cursed Energy and its properties.
- Remaining spell slots and domain refinement (if applicable).
- If they have an innate technique, you learn the target concept and the capabilities of its Lapse technique and any improvements to it. If the technique involves summoning creatures, you only learn the general abilities of the summoned creatures.
- While wearing eye protection, you cannot use this feature.

***Technique Analyzer.*** Your precision allows you to unravel the secrets of techniques. As a reaction to seeing an Extension, Reversal, or Maximum technique used while your eyes are uncovered, or as a bonus action within 1 minute of seeing it used, you may make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against the creature's cursed energy DC. On a failure, you must wait until you see the technique used again. On a success, you learn the technique's capabilities.

***Legendary Name.*** The Six Eyes are a symbol of ultimate power in the jujutsu world, and this reputation precedes you. When a creature that has heard of the Six Eyes sees you for the first time and knows you possess the blessing, they must make a Wisdom saving throw against your cursed energy DC. On a failure, they are frightened by you, and any creature affected by their fear gains advantage on saving throws against your techniques. Additionally, the frightened creature cannot concentrate.

On a success, they are no longer affected by this feature. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns. If the creature’s CR is lower than your Jujutsu Sorcerer level by 10 or more, they cannot repeat the saving throw if they are within 40 meters of you and aware of it. On a success, they remain immune to this feature for 24 hours. You may choose not to affect a creature with this feature.

## Special Grade Curse
*`Prerequisites: Must be a Cursed Spirit`*

You were born from the deepest fears of humanity, achieving Special Grade status from birth. 

As a Special Grade, you gain the benefits of being a Special Grade and all the advantages of the grades that come before it (except Grade 4, as usual). 

Additionally, due to being a naturally born Special Grade, your Cursed Spirit Body Functions and Cursed Feats are stronger than those of other Cursed Spirits.

## Stamina Beast
*`Prerequisites: Must be a Heavenly Restriction`*

Whether through training or simply being born with it, your stamina reserves are naturally immense. 

Your stamina maximum increases by your Heavenly Restriction level, plus your proficiency bonus.

## Star Plasma Vessel
*`Prerequisite: There must be a user of the Six Eyes in the world. The character must be human and female`*

<Note>
	This feat is primarily for role-playing purposes. If you are using background feats and a player wants this one, you can grant them another feat without any balancing issues.
</Note>

You were chosen by fate to serve as a vessel for an ancient Immortality user, allowing them to assimilate you and prevent their evolution into an unimaginable horror.

At the age of 14, you will awaken as a Star Plasma Vessel. You will be able to see cursed spirits and shikigami, even if you have never encountered cursed energy before. Upon awakening, you become easily identifiable to any Jujutsu Sorcerer or Curse User, who will instantly recognize that something is unusual about you and that you are special in some way. The Immortality user becomes aware of your existence the moment you awaken as a Vessel. After your awakening, you have 180 days to merge with the Immortality user you are destined to bond with. If you fail to do so within this time, you will no longer be a proper vessel, and the assimilation will fail.

## Unique Cursed Energy
*`Prerequisites: Must not be a Heavenly Restriction`*

Your cursed energy possesses a unique trait, making it both rare and powerful.

Choose one damage type, excluding necrotic and radiant. This chosen damage type becomes your Cursed Energy Trait. 

While you have Cursed Armor active, you gain resistance to your Cursed Energy Trait. 

Whenever you are hit by a melee attack while under the effects of Cursed Armor, you deal damage equal to your level of your Cursed Energy Trait to the attacking creature. 

When you deal damage with Cursed Strike or Cursed Weapon Enhancement, its damage type can either match your Cursed Energy Trait or remain the same. 

Any features that change their damage type based on your selected Cursed Technique can also change to match your Cursed Energy Trait or remain the same. Your Cursed Energy Trait grants you one of the following options:

- ***Wellspring of Energy.*** Your Cursed Energy maximum increases by your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. If you have a Cursed Feat or similar feature that increases your Cursed Energy maximum, such as one granted by your Cursed Technique or Sorcerer Path, your Cursed Energy maximum is further increased by your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution modifier.

- ***Dynamic Striker.*** Whenever you score a critical hit with an attack roll using a feature affected by your Cursed Energy Trait, or a creature rolls a 1 on the d20 against a feature affected by your Cursed Energy Trait, the creature is afflicted with a condition based on your Cursed Energy Trait (excluding conditions that cause the incapacitated, paralyzed, or restrained conditions; consult with your DM to determine which condition is possible). The condition lasts for 1 minute, but the creature can end it early by succeeding on a saving throw at the beginning of its turn. (The saving throw depends on your Cursed Energy Trait.)

At 14th level, you gain resistance to your Cursed Energy Trait, and if you have Cursed Armor active, you become immune to your Cursed Energy Trait instead. Additionally, whenever you use a feature with its damage type changed to your Cursed Energy Trait, you can bypass any resistance a creature or target has to that damage type, though not any immunities it may possess.
