## Barrier Invader
*`Prerequisite: 18+ Charisma, Barrier Master feat`*

You have learned how to invade barriers without breaking them. You gain the following benefits:

- Once per turn, while outside a barrier, you can make an Arcana check, adding your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), against the cursed save DC of the sorcerer who created the barrier to attempt to invade it. On a failure, you cannot enter the barrier. On a success, you enter the barrier, though the creator will be aware that a creature has entered. If you have Cursed Energy Concealer active, the creator will not know a creature has entered their barrier.
- Once per turn, while inside a barrier, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, adding your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), against the cursed save DC of the sorcerer who created the barrier to alter its properties. On a failure, you cannot modify the barrier. On a success, you may change the barrier's size, length, creatures allowed to enter or leave, or any other properties you are capable of modifying.

None of the features above affect Domain Expansions.

## Barrier Master
*`Prerequisites: Basic Barrier feat, 18+ Charisma`*

You have studied barriers and their effects extensively, making you an invaluable asset in the Jujutsu world.

Whenever you summon your curtain, its hit points are now equal to your Charisma modifier times your Jujutsu Sorcerer level.

Your basic barrier’s hit points are now 20 times the amount of cursed energy spent.

## Basic Barrier
*`Prerequisites: 14+ Charisma`*

You have learned to create basic barriers to protect areas or trap opponents. 

As an action, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) in cursed energy to create a dome starting from yourself with a 1-meter radius and a 3-meter height. For each point of cursed energy spent, the barrier’s radius and height both increase by 3 meters, though you can choose to make it smaller if desired. The barrier has hit points equal to 10 times the amount of cursed energy spent, resistance to all damage from the inside, vulnerability to all damage from the outside, and immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. The barrier has an AC equal to your Cursed Energy DC and automatically fails saving throws. This barrier lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier. You can deactivate the barrier at will (no action required).

Curtain: Emerge from the darkness, blacker than darkness. Purify that which is impure.

As an action, for 5 Cursed Energy, you cover a 400-meter radius area with a sphere of darkness. Upon activation, a dark, liquid-like matter drips down from the sky to form the outer barrier wall in the shape of a sphere that extends underground, appearing as a dome from the surface. The sky becomes dark, regardless of the time of day, provoking any cursed spirits to emerge from hiding. Creatures without levels in the Jujutsu Sorcerer class cannot see inside the barrier, perceiving only the surrounding vegetation. Creatures who can see into the ethereal plane or have levels in the Jujutsu Sorcerer path can see the black sphere.

The curtain lasts for a number of minutes equal to 10 times your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). The curtain has hit points equal to your Charisma modifier times half your Jujutsu Sorcerer level (rounded down). The barrier has an AC equal to your Cursed Energy DC and automatically fails saving throws. It is immune to Poison and Psychic damage.

You may choose to reduce the radius of your curtain, but it cannot be smaller than a 30-meter radius.

## Domain Expansion
*`Prerequisites: Must have a Cursed Technique, 8th level, 20+ Charisma, must NOT have the Non-Lethal Domain Expansion feat`*

When you gain this feat, you unlock access to an Incomplete Domain.

### Incomplete Domain
Through extensive study of your cursed technique and immense creativity, you have reached a point where an Incomplete Domain becomes possible. With your creativity, you have crafted a unique Incomplete Domain. 

A Domain Expansion is typically centered around a concept derived from your cursed technique’s Lapse technique, serving as a guide for its development. You determine how your Incomplete Domain appears, and if you later gain a Domain Expansion, it should resemble the appearance of your Incomplete Domain, though in a more complete form. Work with your DM to define the effects of your Incomplete Domain; these effects should be focused on utility and support, complementing your Cursed Technique.

As an action, you can manifest your domain in its incomplete state within an enclosed space for 1 minute by spending 15 cursed energy. You must be surrounded by objects or barriers in all directions within 27 meters, as you have not yet learned to apply a barrier to your domain. Because your incomplete domain lacks your cursed technique, it does not benefit from the sure-hit feature, but it still enhances your cursed technique. If your cursed technique involves attack rolls, you make them with advantage, and if it involves saving throws, creatures must make those saving throws with disadvantage.

This feature follows all the rules of [Domain Expansion](/domain-expansion/domain-expansion) but cannot gain Refinement Points.

Once you reach 12th level and have the Basic Barrier feat, you may begin working to complete your domain using the rules outlined in Domain Expansion.

### Complete Domain
Through further experience, understanding, and refinement of your domain, you have learned to imbue your cursed technique into your domain. This feature follows all the rules of [Domain Expansion](/domain-expansion/domain-expansion).

By continuously refining your Incomplete Domain, you have imbued your cursed technique onto a barrier, bringing your fully personalized Domain Expansion into existence. With the completion of your Incomplete Domain, its effects are significantly enhanced compared to when it was incomplete. A completed Domain Expansion is typically highly lethal, dealing massive damage or dramatically weakening those trapped within its bounds, or a combination of both in various ways. Work with your DM to determine the specific effects and features of your completed Domain Expansion to reflect the pinnacle of jujutsu sorcery.

You cannot bypass the prerequisite of not having the Non-Lethal Domain Expansion feat through class features, Cursed Techniques, Sorcerer Paths, feats, or cursed feats you possess.

## Hollow Wicker Basket
*`Prerequisites: Basic Barrier feat`*

A technique predating the New Shadow Style’s Simple Domain, most popular during the Golden Age of Sorcery, the Heian Era.

As an action, bonus action, or reaction against being affected by a sure-hit effect of a Domain Expansion, or seeing a Domain Expansion open, for 5 Cursed Energy, you surround yourself with a 5-meter barrier for 1 minute. Within that radius, the sure-hit feature and sure-hit effect of the domain are negated; any one of your choice inside the barrier is unaffected. 

Additionally, the barrier has an amount of hit points equal to 50 times your proficiency bonus. At the start of your turn inside a domain, the barrier takes 3d12 force damage per 100 refinement the domain has. 

If at any point the barrier disappears or breaks, anyone who was protected by it (including you) is immediately struck by the sure-hit effect of the domain if they’re inside one.

The barrier has no effect on cursed techniques or other people entering the barrier; it simply negates sure-hit features and effects.

When you activate this feat, or as a free action while it is active, you may choose to continuously maintain the barrier, requiring concentration but making the barrier no longer take damage at the start of your turn. To do so, you must also have two free hands and, while concentrating, those hands are occupied. You must also continuously chant to concentrate on this feat, meaning you cannot activate anything that requires you to speak while concentrating unless you have some alternative way of speaking (such as a second mouth). If at any point you fail to meet either of these requirements, the concentration ends, causing the barrier to immediately be affected by the sure-hit effect.

## New Shadow Style: Simple Domain
*`Prerequisites: Basic Barrier feat`*

The main technique of the New Shadow Style, also known as "the domain for the weak."

As an action or reaction to a cursed energy attack roll, saving throw, spell, or domain expansion opening, you can spend 5 Cursed Energy to surround yourself with a 5-meter barrier for 1 minute. This barrier does not impede movement. The circle has hit points equal to your proficiency bonus times your refinement points. 

Any innate techniques or spells that target you, creatures inside your simple domain, or areas that overlap with your simple domain will now target the barrier instead, reducing its hit points by the damage they would cause.

While inside the domain, the sure-hit feature and sure-hit effect are negated for creatures within the simple domain. However, at the start of your turn, the simple domain will take 3d12 force damage for every 100 refinement points the domain has. 

Simple domains cannot reduce all incoming damage; they can only dampen it. If you take too much damage from one source, it can penetrate the simple domain and affect you. Your barrier has a damage threshold equal to your proficiency bonus times ¼ of your refinement points. 

If the simple domain takes more damage than this threshold, the excess damage will affect you. However, this damage is dampened, so you only take half of the excess damage (rounded down). The excess damage still affects the simple domain's health.

Damage your simple domain takes at the start of your turn from the barrier of a Domain Expansion will not affect any creatures if it exceeds the simple domain's hit points, nor is it subject to your damage threshold. 

You can also attempt to divert other effects and conditions besides damage to your barrier. When an innate technique or spell inflicts an effect or condition that would hit your barrier, you can make an Arcana check against its attack roll or saving throw DC. On a success, the effect will target the barrier instead of the creatures within the domain. On a failure, the effect proceeds as normal. This Arcana check can be made using Charisma instead of Intelligence.

Your simple domain can be refined with time and practice. The more refined your simple domain becomes, the stronger it gets. You start with 1 refinement point. You can refine your simple domain using the following methods:

- **Training:** On a long rest, you can spend a number of cursed energy up to your proficiency bonus, gaining an equal number of refinement points. You cannot regain this cursed energy until the next long rest.

- **Practice:** Every time you activate your simple domain, you gain 1 refinement point.

- **Resistance:** For every 5 damage your simple domain receives, you gain 1 refinement point.

As your simple domain’s refinement increases, you gain the following benefits:
|Benefit|Description|Refinement Required|
|:-|:-|:-:|
|Barrier Durability|Your simple domain's durability is crucial when using it in battle, so improving it is a primary goal for most users. The hit points of your simple domain are determined by your refinement points times your proficiency bonus.|1+ Refinement Points|
|Quicker Domain|Your simple domain's activation time has improved, giving you an advantage in battle. You can now activate your simple domain as a bonus action.|50+ Refinement Points|

Your refinement points cannot exceed 100.

To use this technique, you must remain in the location where the simple domain was cast and maintain concentration as if concentrating on a spell. You cannot use any innate technique features while concentrating on the simple domain. If you are inside a Domain Expansion, you negate its sure-hit effect on yourself, as it only affects the barrier. You cannot react to the effects of a Domain Expansion with this feat the first time you would get the opportunity after your simple domain ends or is broken.

## Non-Lethal Domain Expansion
*`Prerequisites: Must have a Cursed Technique, 16+ Charisma, Basic Barrier feat, must NOT have the Incomplete Domain feat or Domain Expansion feat`*

<Note>
	You cannot bypass the prerequisites of not having the Incomplete Domain or Domain Expansion feats through class features, Cursed Techniques, Sorcerer Paths, feats, or cursed feats you possess.
</Note>

Through the study of your technique and creative use of its abilities, you have discovered a way to create a Domain Expansion focused on rules and/or conditions, rather than the typical Sure-hit feature that guarantees harm to the target. 

A Non-Lethal Domain Expansion can function in two ways:

- The domain may have a set of rules and/or conditions that you determine upon gaining this cursed feat. These can range from mini-games and complex scenarios to simple mechanics. The condition or set of rules is entirely up to you. Once you've established the conditions and/or rules, you will also determine a unique condition. If this condition is met, your domain ends prematurely without causing Technique Burnout, and you gain a specific benefit for a limited duration, depending on the strength of the benefit.

- Alternatively, your domain may contain a rule that persists throughout its duration. This rule must apply to everyone, including yourself, or only affect you and/or your allies. For example, your domain may center around sumo wrestling, where no one is allowed to touch the floor with their hands. If someone breaks this rule, a negative consequence affects that individual. Rules cannot include things like “I am immortal inside my domain” or “My technique automatically hits anyone I want in the domain.”

Depending on the effectiveness of your domain, its cursed energy cost may change. It could offer a limited number of free uses, lower the domain's overall cost, increase the cost with each use to a maximum limit, or a combination of these options. If your domain is condition-based and ends early, you gain domain refinement points from the Domain Casualties training section upon completing the condition, unless you wish to set a different condition to earn refinement points from another option. Additionally, if your domain destroys another in a Domain Clash, you gain refinement points from the Domain Supremacy training section.

## Refined Sorcerer
*`Prerequisites: 18+ Charisma, Domain Expansion feat or New Shadow Style: Simple Domain feat`*

Domains are a trait that few sorcerers fully understand, let alone master, as the process is time-consuming, and many sorcerers never reach their true potential. However, a select few sorcerers possess an exceptional understanding of domains. 

- **If you have a Simple Domain**, all methods of refining the domain will grant additional refinement points equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, plus 1.

- **If you have a Domain Expansion**, all methods of refining the domain will grant additional refinement points equal to your Charisma modifier, plus 1. Furthermore, the Domain Expansion Training method can still be used to refine your domain even if your refinement has reached the 500 threshold.

## Simple Domain Imbuement
*`Prerequisites: 20+ Charisma, Basic Barrier feat`*

You have learned how to imbue a Simple Domain of the New Shadow Style into an item or object. 

At the end of a long rest, you may create a number of imbuements equal to your proficiency bonus, spending 2 cursed energy for each imbuement. 

You can choose to imbue your Simple Domain into a melee weapon, a piece of ammunition, or an object, and the imbued effect lasts until the next long rest. 

When used on a melee weapon or piece of ammunition, if you hit with them while they possess an imbued Simple Domain, you may expend an imbuement to allow that attack to bypass innate technique defenses. A weapon or piece of ammunition benefiting from Simple Domain Imbuement cannot have an innate technique feature used or active on it.

Additionally, while you have an imbued item in your possession, you may expend an imbuement to cast New Shadow Style: Simple Domain. Even if you do not possess New Shadow Style: Simple Domain, you may use the training method to refine your Simple Domain over a long rest, up to a maximum refinement of 75.

## Vowless Simple Domain
*`Prerequisites: 20+ Charisma, New Shadow Style: Simple Domain feat, 50 Simple Domain Refinement`*

You have mastered the Simple Domain technique to the point that it no longer requires a binding vow to be used. 

You can now move freely while concentrating on the Simple Domain, as opposed to being unable to move without ending concentration. 

Additionally, you can use your Cursed Technique features while concentrating on the Simple Domain. 

If your own cursed techniques or spells target a creature within your Simple Domain, they will still target the creature instead of the barrier.
