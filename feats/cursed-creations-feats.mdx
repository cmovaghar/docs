## Cursed Blacksmith
*`Prerequisites: 8th level, Cursed Weapon Enhancement feature`*

You are highly skilled at creating Cursed Tools. 

Upon taking this feat, you gain all three options from the Hiroshima Jujutsu School Advanced Studies class feature. 

At 11th level, you can create Grade 3 Cursed Tools using this feature. Armor you create will have 10 + (10 times your Jujutsu Sorcerer level) hit points. Sight Improvement items you create will grant a bonus to Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks equal to your Charisma modifier + half your Charisma modifier.

At 14th level, you can create Grade 2 Cursed Tools using this feature. Armor you create will have 10 + (15 times your Jujutsu Sorcerer level) hit points. Sight Improvement items you create will grant a bonus to Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks equal to twice your Charisma modifier.

At 17th level, you can create Grade 1 Cursed Tools using this feature. When making armor, you can choose one damage type that isnâ€™t Necrotic or Radiant to apply resistance to, as long as the armor still has hit points. Armor can only have one damage resistance at a time, but this can be changed during a long rest by someone with the Cursed Blacksmith feat who is at least 17th level. Sight Improvement items you create will allow the wearer to make Sight-based Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks with advantage.

Additionally, if you possess an Innate Technique, you gain the following benefit:

- You have learned how to create cursed tools more efficiently using your technique. When making a Technique Imbued Cursed Tool, you no longer need to spend the maximum amount of energy each time and only need to enhance the weapon 50 times instead of 150.

## Cursed Child
*`Prerequisites: Cursed Experimenter feat, female, capable of having children`*

Your fascination with the sorcerer world knows no bounds, and experimenting with your child is just another way to satisfy your curiosity. During the nine months of pregnancy, you can spend 30 cursed energy per month to experiment with the child. Once the child is born, they will gain one of the following benefits:

- One of their score maximums will be increased to 24.
- They will gain one background feat that is not the Six Eyes, Blessing of the Twin, Cursed Partner, or Star Plasma Vessel feats.
- They will gain additional hit points at every level equal to your Jujutsu Sorcerer level.

## Cursed Corpse Creator
*`Prerequisites: 16+ Charisma`*

You gain access to [Cursed Corpse Creation](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Cursed_Corpse_Creation_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)), allowing you to create tiny or small Cursed Corpses.

## Cursed Experimenter
*`Prerequisites: 12th level, 16+ Intelligence, 20+ Charisma, Cursed Blacksmith feat`*

You have always had an abnormal curiosity about the sorcerer world, eager to see what happens when you mix different elements together.

- You gain advantage on search checks for cursed objects.
- You gain advantage on Arcana checks involving sorcery.
- You are also able to create nonliving cursed tools and objects. The rules for creating them are outlined below.

***Cursed Object and Tool Creation.*** Creating cursed objects and tools is no easy task. It requires significant time, money, and cursed energy. To create a cursed tool or object, first decide on the desired effect. Work with your GM to determine the grade of your creation based on its effect. Then, based on the grade, you will determine the amount of time, money, and cursed energy required for its creation.

|Cursed Creation Grade|Cost in GP|Cursed Energy Needed|Time Needed|
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Grade 4|50|10|2 hours|
|Grade 3|300|50|6 hours|
|Grade 2|1000|100|12 hours|
|Grade 1|2500|250|24 hours|
|Special Grade|5000|500|48 hours|

If you are attempting to create something with an effect similar to that of another tool, object, or your innate technique (or someone else's), the time required to create it is reduced. If you have a tool or object to copy, or if someone can assist you in the creation process using their innate technique, the time to create the tool or object is halved.

## Cursed Object Creator
*`Prerequisites: 16th level, 20+ Charisma, 16+ Intelligence, 1 Soul Knowledge`*

Through time and experience, you have mastered the ability to transform living creatures into cursed objects. 

You gain access to [Cursed Object Creation](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Cursed_Objects_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)).

## Shikigami Summon
*`Prerequisites: 16+ Charisma, one talisman (a paper imbued with your cursed energy)`*

You have acquired a talisman, a symbol or seal used to summon Shikigami. 

Choose one Shikigami from the [Shikigami list](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Bestiary_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)#Shikigami), with a CR equal to or lower than half your level (rounded down). You can now spend an action to summon the chosen Shikigami by expending a number of cursed energy equal to its CR (minimum 1).

To control and command your Shikigami, use the [Summon Commanding Rules](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Variant_Rules_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)#Summon_Commanding_Rules). Your Shikigami regains all lost hit points after a long rest. If the Shikigami dies, you cannot summon it again until you take a long rest.

The distance you can summon your Shikigami is 15 ft.

You may take this feat multiple times. Any Shikigami obtained through the Taming Shikigami and Cursed Spirits variant rule also count towards your limit on how many Shikigami you can control.
