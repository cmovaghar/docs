## Improved Output
*`Prerequisites: Reverse Cursed Technique feat, Positive Energy Master sorcerer path`*

Your output of reverse cursed energy has increased, allowing you to heal others instead of yourself. You can cause a non-Cursed Spirit creature within your reach to benefit from reverse cursed technique, instead of healing yourself. When used this way, reverse cursed technique is only half as efficient, and the creature regains half the hit points you would. Lost limbs cannot regain hit points when using reverse cursed technique on a creature other than yourself.

Additionally, whenever you deal damage to a Cursed Spirit with an unarmed strike, melee weapon, or natural weapon, you can spend cursed energy to convert hit points from your healing pool into radiant damage. You deal 5 radiant damage per 1 cursed energy spent, up to a maximum equal to your Charisma modifier in cursed energy. Alternatively, as an action, you can make a melee weapon attack roll against a Cursed Spirit within reach. On a hit, you may spend cursed energy as if healing with reverse cursed technique, dealing 5 radiant damage per cursed energy spent and removing the same amount of hit points from your healing pool. When using Improved Output in either of these ways, you cannot apply Cursed Strikes or Cursed Weapon Enhancement to the melee weapon attack.

## Improved Reverse Cursed Technique
*`Prerequisites: Reverse Cursed Technique feat`*

You have gained a deep understanding of positive energy, elevating your abilities as a sorcerer. 

You gain the following benefits:

- Your reverse cursed technique healing pool is increased to 10 times your level, multiplied by your Charisma modifier.
- You now regain 20 hit points for each point of cursed energy spent.
- You recover 10 hit points from your healing pool at the start of each of your turns.
- The DC to force reverse cursed technique is reduced to 20.
- Hit points healed can now restore lost limbs.
- By healing 10 hit points with Reverse Cursed Technique, you can end the poisoned condition on yourself.

## Reverse Cursed Technique
*`Prerequisites: 8th level, 17+ Charisma, have failed two death saves in the same combat and survived`*

Through many battles and extensive study of your cursed energy, you learn to channel it in an entirely opposite way, using positive energy instead of negative. You gain a pool of healing equal to 5 times your level multiplied by your Charisma modifier, which you can use with your Reverse Cursed Energy. As a bonus action, for a certain amount of cursed energy, you can draw healing from this pool to regain hit points. You can also draw from this pool as a reaction when you take damage. For every 1 cursed energy spent, you regain 10 hit points, and an equal amount is removed from the pool. If you are suffering from a physical injury such as a concussion, one of these injuries can be healed for every 10 hit points you restore with Reverse Cursed Technique. This cannot restore lost limbs.

You can continue using your Reverse Cursed Technique until your healing pool is depleted. Afterward, you cannot use it again until the pool recovers, which leads to burnout. At the start of each of your turns, if your life is in danger, you regain 5 hit points of your healing pool. The pool fully replenishes at the end of a long rest, or at the end of a short rest if you recover cursed energy during a short rest.

Once per round, you may attempt to use Reverse Cursed Technique even while experiencing burnout, forcing you to make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you gain 1 level of exhaustion, which can be reduced by taking either a short or long rest (instead of only a long rest). On a success, you regain half the usual number of hit points.
