## Dense Cursed Energy
*`Prerequisites: 20+ Charisma, Overflowing Cursed Energy feat or Natural Sorcerer feat, at least two Cursed Energy Enhancements`*

Your cursed energy is far denser than that of a typical sorcerer, allowing you to enhance your techniques with greater potency.

You can choose one of the following options:

- Dense Strikes. Your Cursed Strike damage dice tier increases to a d12.
- Durable Armor. The temporary hit points granted by your Cursed Energy Armor are now equal to the amount of Cursed Energy spent × 15, increasing to × 20 at 11th level.
- Destructive Weapon Enhancement. Your Cursed Weapon Enhancement extra damage is now equal to the amount of Cursed Energy spent × 4.
- Cursed Enhancement. Whenever you use a damage-dealing feature that utilizes Cursed Energy, its damage dice increase by one tier (d6 → d8 → d10). This does not apply to Cursed Strikes if you have chosen the Dense Strikes option, as that is already an increase from this feat. It also does not apply to Cursed Strike’s Cursed Energy Enhancement.

If you gain the Improved Cursed Energy Output feat, you may choose an additional option from this feat. If you later gain the Legendary Cursed Energy Output feat, you may choose another option. Finally, if you obtain the Divine Cursed Energy Output feat, you may select one more option.

## Cursed Energy Concealer
*`Prerequisites: 14+ Charisma, must have proficiency in Stealth`*

- Your Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You have mastered the art of concealing both your presence and cursed energy. You may Hide as a bonus action by making a Stealth check. For the next 10 minutes, you do not leave behind cursed energy traces. Any creature attempting to track or sense your energy must succeed on a contested check against your Stealth roll + your Charisma modifier if they have an ability or feature that allows them to track cursed energy. If they lack such an ability, they cannot track you at all.
- While both you and your cursed energy are hidden, the benefits of being an Unseen Attacker extend to your saving throws, forcing affected creatures to roll their saving throws against your abilities with disadvantage.

## Cursed Energy Tracker
*`Prerequisites: 14+ Charisma, must have proficiency in Perception`*

- Your Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You have learned to detect traces of cursed energy. You may make a Perception check, adding your Charisma modifier, to search for lingering cursed energy in your surroundings. If you succeed, you can identify exactly who the energy belongs to. If you do not know the person, you can only track where the cursed energy trail leads. The DC for this check is equal to the Cursed Energy DC of the creature you are tracking.
- You can read the flow of others’ cursed energy. You are aware whenever a creature you can see spends cursed energy and how much they spend. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can focus on one creature for 1 minute, allowing you to see the “sparks” of cursed energy that occur just before a cursed technique is used. For that duration, when that creature forces you to make a saving throw with a cursed technique or makes a cursed energy attack roll against you using a cursed technique, they must roll Stealth using Charisma instead of Dexterity, opposed by your Perception. If you succeed, you gain advantage on the saving throw, or their attack roll is made with disadvantage.

## Focused Rage
*`Prerequisites: 8th Level, Negative Flow feat`*

By deepening your understanding of cursed energy generation, you have learned to harness your negative emotions with greater control, refining them into raw power.

While under any of the conditions listed in the Negative Flow feat, you may concentrate to increase the temporary cursed energy gained at the start of your turn to your full Charisma modifier. If the conditions from Negative Flow end, you immediately lose concentration on this effect.

This feat can be maintained even while under the bloodlust or berserk conditions.

## Immense Cursed Energy
*`Prerequisites: 15+ Charisma`*

Your cursed energy reserves are vast, making you a powerhouse of cursed energy. 

You gain the following benefits:

- Your Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When determining your total Cursed Energy, you add your proficiency bonus and may add your Charisma modifier an additional time.

## Negative Flow
*`Prerequisites: 4th Level`*

By understanding that cursed energy is fueled by negative emotions, you have learned to generate your own cursed energy in moments of distress.

Whenever you are frightened, berserked, bloodlusted, below half your maximum hit points, missing a limb, or in an encounter where the total CR exceeds your level, you gain temporary cursed energy at the start of your turn equal to half your Charisma modifier (rounded down). This temporary cursed energy cannot exceed one-fourth of your maximum cursed energy.

## Overflowing Cursed Energy
*`Prerequisites: 17+ Charisma, Immense Cursed Energy feat`*

Your cursed energy reserves are so vast that they seem nearly limitless, allowing you to perform incredible feats of Jujutsu even when others have exhausted their energy.

You gain the following benefits:

- Your Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When calculating your maximum Cursed Energy, you add half your character level (rounded up) plus your proficiency bonus.

## Overpowering Cursed Energy
*`Prerequisites: Overflowing Cursed Energy feat or Natural Sorcerer feat or Cursed Partner feat`*

Your cursed energy is so immense and overwhelming that it physically affects those around you. When a creature attempts to track or sense your cursed energy, they must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Cursed Energy DC. On a success, they perceive your cursed energy but remain unaffected. On a failure, they are frightened for 1 minute and suffer the following detriments:

- They hesitate under your suffocating presence. Their ability checks, saving throws, attack rolls, as well as their Spell Save DC, Maneuver Save DC, and Cursed Energy Save DC are reduced by your Charisma modifier (maximum reduction of -5).
- Their focus wavers. They cannot concentrate on spells or abilities.
- They are paralyzed by fear. They have disadvantage on saving throws against your features, while you have advantage on saving throws against theirs.

A creature may remake this saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's CR or level is equal to or higher than your Jujutsu Sorcerer level, they make this saving throw with advantage. If their CR or level is three or more below yours, they make the saving throw with disadvantage.

Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, they become immune to Overpowering Cursed Energy for 24 hours if they are three or more levels below you. However, if their level is equal to or higher than yours, they remain immune until you surpass their level.

When you roll initiative, you may target any number of creatures within a range equal to (your current Cursed Energy ÷ 10) × your Charisma modifier (in meters). These creatures must make the Wisdom saving throw as if they had attempted to track or sense your cursed energy.

The effects of Overpowering Cursed Energy immediately end on any creature that has 15 or more Maximum Cursed Energy than you, and such creatures automatically succeed on all saving throws against this feature.
