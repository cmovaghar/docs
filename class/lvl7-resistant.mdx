title: 'Level 7: Resistant'
description: ''
---

Your strength as a sorcerer allows you to resist certain area effects. Choose one of the following ability scores

|Ability|Effect|
|:-|:-|
|Strength|Brawn|
|Dexterity|Evasion|
|Constitution|Endurance|
|Intelligence|Discernment|
|Wisdom|Intuition|

You can only choose the option associated with a certain ability score if you have a 16 or higher in that ability score. If none of your ability scores except Charisma are at or above 16, you may only choose the one that is your highest, or any of your highest in the case of a tie.

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a saving throw using the chosen ability score to only take half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

At 20th level, you can choose one additional saving throw.
