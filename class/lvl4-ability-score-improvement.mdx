title: 'Level 4: Ability Score Improvement'
description: ''
---

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 15th, 16th, 18th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. 

You cannot increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Alternatively, you may choose to ignore this increase and instead gain a [Cursed Feat]() that you meet the prerequisites for.
