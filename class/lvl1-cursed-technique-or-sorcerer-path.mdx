title: 'Level 1: Cursed Technique or Sorcerer Path'
description: ''
---

You can choose between being born with or without an innate technique. Choose either a Cursed Technique or a Sorcerer Path.

### Cursed Technique 
Cursed Techniques are unique abilities ingrained into the user's body, specifically in the right prefrontal cortex of the brain. Most jujutsu sorcerers manifest their innate technique around the age of five or six, and over time, this technique continually shapes and carves its formula into the user. 

You must choose one innate technique from the options detailed under [Cursed Techniques](). 

Every innate technique grants you a specific Cursed Technique, which offers a variety of uses.

- Anything that prevents you from casting spells, such as an Antimagic Field, also prevents you from using innate techniques unless they are in their Reversal or Maximum Output forms.
- Techniques typically require somatic and verbal components to cast, represented as "S" (somatic) and "V" (verbal) followed by a number. For "S," the number represents the number of free hands required (e.g., "S-1" means one hand), and for "V," it represents the number of free mouths required.
- When a technique’s action cost is reduced to a free action or lower, you may reduce its "S" by 1. At the DM’s discretion, you may lower its "V" by 1 at the cost of increasing "S" by 2.
- If a technique requires physically touching something to be used, its "S" cannot go below 1.

### Sorcerer Path
You were born without an innate technique. However, this hasn't stopped you from pursuing your ambitions as a sorcerer, and you've adapted in your own way. 

You must choose a [Sorcerer Path](), which will be detailed in the Sorcerer Paths section below. 

Your choice grants you features at 1st, 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 20th levels.
