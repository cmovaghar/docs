You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed and not wearing armor or wielding a shield.

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.

- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. This die changes as you gain Jujutsu Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the [Jujutsu Sorcerer table]().

- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike or attack with a one-handed weapon as a bonus action.

- You gain access to Sorcerer Weapons. You may use your martial arts damage die instead of the Sorcerer weapon damage die if you choose to do so.
