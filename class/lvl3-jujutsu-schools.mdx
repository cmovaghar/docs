<Accordion title="Tokyo Jujutsu High">
	You come from a more liberal school where you chose not to focus on the basics but instead to improve your Innate Technique.
	
	You learn three enhancements that you can apply to one of your Lapse, Extension, or Reversal techniques. A technique can only have one enhancement, and an enhancement cannot be applied to multiple techniques.
	
	- ***Power Enhancement.*** You can now spend additional cursed energy up to your proficiency bonus on the technique to add an additional damage die for each cursed energy spent.
	- ***Cursed Energy Economy.*** The cursed energy cost of the technique is now reduced by your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 1 cursed energy).
	- ***Distance Enhancement.*** You can spend additional cursed energy up to your proficiency bonus on the technique to add 3 meters to its range for each cursed energy spent.
	
	When an enhancement is applied to a Lapse technique, it will also apply to any further Technique Improvements directly related to it. After a short rest or long rest, you may reallocate your enhancements.
	
	<Note>
    If you have a *Sorcerer Path* instead of a *Cursed Technique* and select *Tokyo Jujutsu High* as your Jujutsu School, you instead gain the benefits below.
    </Note>

<Accordion title="Kyoto Jujutsu High">
	You come from a very conservative school where you learned to set aside your individuality as a jujutsu sorcerer in order to focus on mastering the basic jujutsu arts better than anyone else.
	
	Your Cursed Martial Arts techniques now each cost only 1 cursed energy to perform, and you may choose an additional Cursed Energy Enhancement feature. Additionally, one of your Cursed Martial Arts is more refined than the average sorcerer's. Choose one of the following:
	
	- ***Cursed Blast of Blows.*** When you use this feature, you can now make three unarmed strikes instead of two.
	- ***Cursed Patient Defense.*** You gain advantage on Constitution and Strength saving throws when you use the Dodge action granted by this feature, as long as you benefit from the Dodge.
	- ***Cursed Wind Step.*** When you take the Dash action granted by this feature, you instead gain extra movement equal to twice your speed. Additionally, when you take the Disengage action granted by this feature, you gain extra movement equal to your speed for the current turn.
