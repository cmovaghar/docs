Choose between Advanced Studies or Advanced Sorcerer Training.

## Advanced Studies
Your talents have been refined by the teachings of your Jujutsu High. You receive one of the following benefits depending on which school you chose at level 3.

<Accordion title="Tokyo Jujutsu High">
	You have a favorite technique, which you have enhanced to its maximum potential. This technique has become your specialized technique. One of your Lapse, Extension, or Reversal techniques gains all of the following benefits:

	- ***Increased Damage Output.*** Its damage dice number will increase by your Charisma modifier.
	- ***Increased Reach.*** Its range will increase by 10 meters, unless it has a touch range.
	- ***Optimized Technique.*** Its cursed energy cost will be halved (rounded up, minimum 1).

	You may change your specialized technique whenever you gain an ability score increase in this class or when you reach level 20 in this class.
</Accordion>
  
<Accordion title="Kyoto Jujutsu High">
	You have been improving your cursed energy usage, striving to master the basics of all aspects of jujutsu and become an exemplary sorcerer. You gain one additional Cursed Energy Enhancement and the following stronger enhancements:

	- ***Stronger Cursed Strikes.*** Creatures of your choice within 1 meter of the impact take a number of d12 of the same damage type equal to half the cursed energy spent (rounded down). Objects take twice the damage from this effect.
	- ***Durable Cursed Armor.*** Your armor now also grants you damage reduction equal to twice your Charisma modifier.
	- ***Precise Cursed Weapon.*** Half of the cursed energy spent (rounded down) adds to the weapon's attack rolls. In addition, when hitting another creature, you may choose to treat any immunity that creature has to your Cursed Weapon Enhancement damage type as resistance. You may only treat immunities as resistances a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before needing to take a long rest.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hiroshima Jujutsu High">
	You have been honing your use of cursed creations, and this has granted you the ability to create tools. After focusing on normal objects for 1 hour, you can turn them into Cursed Tools. You learn how to create one of the following Cursed Tools:

	- ***Weapon.*** You enhance the weapon greatly, making it deadly enough to cut through even evil spirits. Attacks with the item deal additional necrotic damage equal to its damage dice + your Charisma modifier. If a creature is killed by a cursed weapon, it cannot be turned into undead or revived by any means other than true resurrection or wish.
	- ***Sight Improvement.*** You enhance glasses, lenses, or other forms of visual equipment to access the supernatural. A creature holding the item gains a bonus to Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). If you cannot normally see cursed spirits, you are able to do so while wearing these glasses.
	- ***Armor.*** You enhance the protection to resist even powerful cursed attacks. While a creature is wearing the armor, they gain temporary hit points equal to 10 + 5 times your jujutsu sorcerer level. After the temporary hit points end, they are regained at the end of your next long rest. This can only be applied to clothes or armor.

	After the alteration, the item becomes a grade 4 cursed tool.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ainu Jujutsu High">
	You have a favorite barrier, which you have enhanced to its maximum potential. This barrier cannot be a domain barrier. It has become your specialized barrier, gaining all of the following benefits:

	- ***Increased Durability.*** Its hit points increase by an amount equal to 10 times your Charisma modifier.

	- ***Increased Radius.*** Its radius increases by 10 meters unless it has a touch range.

	- ***Optimized Usage.*** Its cursed energy cost is halved (rounded up, minimum 1).

	You may change your specialized barrier whenever you gain an ability score increase in this class or when you reach level 20 in this class.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sendai Jujutsu High">
	You have been improving your cursed energy usage, striving to master the fundamentals of jujutsu and become an exemplary sorcerer. You gain one additional [Cursed Energy Enhancement](lvl2-cursed-energy-enhancement) and the following stronger enhancements:

	- ***Defensive Cursed Strikes.*** When hit by a melee or ranged attack, you may use your reaction to reduce the damage by an amount equal to your cursed strike damage. Doing so consumes cursed energy as if you had used a cursed strike normally.

	- ***Durable Cursed Armor.*** Your armor now grants you resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage.

	- ***Cursed Weapon Deflection.*** When hit by a melee or ranged attack, you can use your reaction to deflect the attack. The damage is reduced by your weapon damage die + your cursed weapon enhancement damage.
