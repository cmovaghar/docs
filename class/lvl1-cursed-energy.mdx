Your training has granted you control over the cursed energy within you. `Charisma` is your cursed energy modifier for any cursed energy-powered features. 

You have a number of cursed energy points equal to twice your Jujutsu Sorcerer level plus your `Charisma modifier`, as shown in the cursed energy column of the [Jujutsu Sorcerer table](). You can spend these points to fuel various features.

You regain all spent cursed energy after a `Long Rest`.

Some applications of cursed energy require the target to make a saving throw to resist the effect. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

#### Cursed Energy Save DC 
`8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

#### Cursed Energy Attack Roll
`Your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`
