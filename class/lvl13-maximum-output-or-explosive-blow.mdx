---

Choose between Maximum Output or Explosive Blow.

## Maximum Output
You have learned to use your maximum output, channeling the highest possible cursed energy into your techniques. As a bonus action, you can spend cursed energy equal to the original cost of one of your Lapse, Reversal, Extension, or Maximum techniques twice. The first time you pay this cost, any reductions that apply to the technique are applied. The second time, no reductions are applied. This amplifies the cursed energy output, granting two of the following benefits the next time the technique is cast:

- ***Increased Range and Area of Effect.*** The technique's range and area of effect are increased by half of its original range (rounded up). This does not apply to touch-based techniques.

- ***Increased Damage Dice.*** The technique's damage dice is increased by half of its original damage dice or bonus (rounded up). For example, a technique that deals 10d10 damage would add 5d10 damage to the total.

- ***Increased Bonus to Hit.*** The technique's bonus to hit is increased by half of its original bonus (rounded up). For example, a technique with a +7 to hit would add +4 to hit in its maximum output form.

- ***Increased DC.*** The technique's DC is increased by half of your proficiency bonus (rounded up).

- ***Increased Duration.*** The technique's duration is increased by half of its original duration. For example, a technique that lasts 1 minute would last 1 minute and 5 rounds.

You cannot choose the same benefit twice.

## Explosive Blow
Certain sorcerers, while not grasping the concept of Maximum Output, have honed their focus on releasing an explosive burst of cursed energy. 

As a bonus action, you can concentrate to channel a condensed portion of your cursed energy into either your limbs or a weapon for 8 cursed energy. 

For 1 minute after you perform this bonus action, your next melee attack adds half of your attack’s damage dice (rounded down) as extra damage to the damage roll. If you take damage from any source during this time, you must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher, to maintain concentration.

Alternatively, as a bonus action when you land a melee attack, you can expend 10 cursed energy to add half of your attack’s damage dice (rounded down) to the damage roll.

For 14 cursed energy (instead of 8 or 10), your melee attack with this feature will add the full damage dice of your attack, rather than just half, to the damage roll.

When you land a successful melee attack that benefits from Explosive Blow, the target is knocked back a number of feet equal to either your attack’s ability modifier or Charisma modifier, times 10, in a direction of your choice. 

If the target collides with an unsecured object or structure, both the creature and the object or structure take 1d10 bludgeoning damage for every 1 meter the creature had left to travel after impact (up to a maximum of 10d10). 

If the target is another creature, they take damage equal to half of your attack’s damage roll instead.
