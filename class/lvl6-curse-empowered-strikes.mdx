title: 'Level 6: Curse-Empowered Strikes'
description: ''
---

You begin to focus more cursed energy into your strikes or your weapon. 

Your attacks with weapons or unarmed strikes, whichever you choose when you gain this feature, now count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances and immunities to damage from nonmagical attacks. 

You may also add an extra necrotic damage die to the total damage of your choice, depending on your Charisma modifier.

|Jujutsu Density|Damage Dice|
|:-:|:-:|
|If your Charisma modifier is +1|d4|
|If your Charisma modifier is +2|d6|
|If your Charisma modifier is +3|d8|
|If your Charisma modifier is +4|d10|
|If your Charisma modifier is +5|d12|

Depending on your Cursed Technique, the extra damage die may change to a specific damage type.

At 11th level, attacks with the option you didn't choose at 6th level are now also considered magical.
