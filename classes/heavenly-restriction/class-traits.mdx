Creatures born with the "perfect" Heavenly Restriction have been denied access to cursed energy or spellcasting, having no affinity for either. However, in exchange for this, they are blessed with an extraordinary physique. Due to lacking jujutsu talent, they are often shamed by most of jujutsu society and endure hardships during childhood. Perfect Heavenly Restrictions tend to foster unique personalities due to the ostracism and challenges they face in life.

The Heavenly Restriction applies only to living beings with physical bodies, and even then, it is extremely rare. When creating a character for this class, ensure that the creature is not one of the following types: Undead, Construct, or Elemental.

When creating a Heavenly Restriction character, consider how you were treated because of it. Were you exiled by your clan? Shamed by others for your condition? Or did you choose to leave everything behind and live on your own, away from societyâ€™s judgment? Reflecting on how your character experienced these challenges will help shape their personality and motivations.
