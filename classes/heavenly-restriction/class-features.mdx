As a Heavenly Restriction, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Restrained Body
Your body is simply built differently from others. You possess supernatural strength, speed, and durability. 

You gain the following traits:

***Supernatural Body.*** You gain a +2 bonus to one of your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, or Wisdom scores. At 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels, you can choose another score to increase by +2.

Additionally, your maximums for Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, and Wisdom increase to 22. These maximums increase to 24 at 5th level, to 26 at 11th level, and to 30 at 17th level.

***Invisible.*** You cannot be tracked by magical means. Abilities that sense ki, cursed energy, magic, or similar forces do not work on you.

***Pure Body.*** Your body has no traces of any kind of mystical energy, meaning you cannot multiclass or learn magic or cursed energy. 

If you had abilities that previously relied on magic or cursed energy, you lose them (for example, you cannot multiclass into the Jujutsu Sorcerer class).

## Level 1: Unarmored Mastery
Due to your enhanced body and senses, you have mastered the art of fighting while wearing next to nothing. 

You gain the following benefits as long as you are unarmored:

***Unarmored Defense.*** As long as you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield, your AC becomes 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.

***Unarmored Movement.*** Your speed increases by 5 meters while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain Heavenly Restriction levels, as shown in the Heavenly Restriction table. Additionally, you gain the ability to move and run along vertical surfaces and across liquids during your turn without falling while moving.

## Level 1: Martial Arts
Your practice of martial arts has granted you mastery over combat styles that utilize unarmed strikes, melee martial weapons, and simple weapons. 

You gain the following benefits:

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, melee martial weapons, and simple weapons.
- You can roll a 2d4 for the damage of your unarmed strikes, melee martial weapons, and simple weapons, instead of the normal damage. This die changes as you gain Heavenly Restriction levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Heavenly Restriction table.
- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike, melee martial weapon, or simple weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. (For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.)
- You gain access to Sorcerer Weapons. You may use your martial arts damage die instead of the sorcerer weapon damage die if you choose to do so.

## Level 2: Fighting Style
You have acquired your very own fighting style. 

Choose one of the following fighting styles. Whenever you finish a long rest, you may change your fighting style to another one of your choice.

- ***Blind Warrior.*** You gain blindsight with a range in meters equal to twice your proficiency bonus. Within this range, you can see invisible targets and anything that isn't behind total cover or hidden from you.

- ***Classical Swordplay.*** While wielding a finesse weapon and no other weapons, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls and AC, as long as you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.

- ***Deadeye.*** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

- ***Dual Wielding.*** When you take the Attack action while two-weapon fighting, you can make the single bonus attack with your off-hand weapon as part of your Attack action, instead of using your bonus action. Add your ability modifier to the damage of this attack.

- ***Great Weapon Fighting.*** You add your proficiency bonus to damage rolls with heavy weapons.

- ***Heavyweight Fighting.*** While wielding a heavy melee weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls and have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to shove.

- ***Improved Unarmored Defense.*** You gain a +1 bonus to your AC while not wearing any armor or shield.

- ***Lightfoot Fighter.*** While wielding a light melee weapon, your walking speed increases by 3 meters, and you do not provoke opportunity attacks from the last creature you attacked on your turn, as long as it was made with a light weapon.

- ***Point-Blank Shooter.*** When you make a ranged attack against a target within 1 meters of you, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. When you make an opportunity attack, you can replace the melee attack with a ranged attack.

- ***Protector.*** When a creature you can see hits you, or a target within 1 meters of you, with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to the target's Armor Class against that attack. You must be wielding a shield or a melee weapon.

- ***Sharpened Shot.*** You gain a bonus to damage rolls you make using ranged weapons equal to your proficiency bonus.

- ***Improvised Fighting.*** You are considered proficient with improvised weapons and can treat them as Sorcerer Weapons.

## Level 2: Battle Master
Due to the immense training you have done with your body, you have learned how to use battle maneuvers.

***Battle Maneuvers.*** You have a number of [battle maneuvers](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Heavenly_Restriction_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)#Heavenly_Maneuvers) equal to half your Heavenly Restriction level (rounded down). At the end of a long rest, you may change one of your battle maneuvers for another that you meet the requirements for.

***Stamina.*** Some maneuvers utilize stamina points. You have a number of stamina points equal to your level + your Constitution modifier.

***Effort Dice.*** Some maneuvers utilize effort dice. Your effort dice start out as a d6 and increases to a d8 at 5th level, to a d10 at 11th level, and to a d12 at 17th level.

***Battle Maneuver Save DC.*** Some of your battle maneuvers will force a creature to make a saving throw. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

`8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)`

## Level 3: Uncanny Mindset
With the constant enhancement of your body, your mind has evolved as well. 

You have developed various uncanny mindsets, which help you through battle in different ways.

You gain two [Uncanny Mindsets](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Heavenly_Restriction_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)#Uncanny_Mindsets) of your choice that you meet the requirements for.

You gain two more uncanny mindsets at 5th level, 7th level, 10th level, 13th level, and 18th level.

***Versatile Mind.*** Whenever you gain a level in this class, you may change one of your mindsets for another mindset you qualify for.

***Body Training.*** Whenever you pick two mindsets of different types (e.g., choosing one Strength mindset and one Speed mindset), you gain a number of Body Points equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). If you choose two mindsets of the same type, you gain a number of Body Points equal to your proficiency bonus, but these Body Points may only be spent on [Body Improvements](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Heavenly_Restriction_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)#Body_Improvements_List) that match the type of Mindset you chose. This only applies when you gain new mindsets, not when you switch them.

## Level 3: Enhanced Senses
Your Heavenly Restriction has made your senses far more powerful than a regular person's.

- ***Smell.*** Your sense of smell is far beyond human, comparable to that of trained dogs and other animals. You can easily differentiate between various sources of smells, such as foliage, people, water, and other substances, within a range equal to 6 times your Wisdom modifier in meters.

- ***Sight.*** Your sense of sight is highly attuned to detail, like that of birds of prey. You can see twice as far as a normal person with fine detail, ensuring that even the smallest things don't escape your notice.

- ***Hearing.*** Your hearing is, contrary to most humans, just as reliable as or even more acute than your other senses. Even when you can't rely on sight, your hearing keeps you aware of your surroundings. While you are not deafened, you gain blindsight with a range of 10 meters.

## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above your ability score limit using this feature.

Alternatively, you may choose to forgo this increase and instead gain a Cursed Feat.

## Level 5: Semi-Awakened Body
Your body has grown stronger, its physique now absorbing more of the restriction. 

You gain a +2 to your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, or Wisdom scores, up to your maximum.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in either Strength or Dexterity saving throws (you cannot choose a saving throw you're already proficient in). If you were already proficient in both saving throws, you gain proficiency with one other saving throw you weren't proficient with before.

## Level 5: Extra Attack
You can now attack twice instead of once when you take the Attack action. 

This increases to three attacks at 11th level and four attacks at 17th level.

## Level 7: Resistant
Your newfound abilities and body have allowed you to resist certain area effects.

Choose one of the following ability scores

|Ability|Effect|
|:-|:-|
|Strength|Brawn|
|Dexterity|Evasion|
|Constitution|Endurance|
|Intelligence|Discernment|
|Wisdom|Intuition|

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a saving throw using the chosen ability score to only take half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

At 11th and 17th levels, you can choose one additional saving throw.

## Level 9: Faster Recovery
Your stamina recovers much faster than it used to. 

While in combat, you regain 1 stamina point at the beginning of your turn, up to your maximum.

The combat must involve a situation where your life is at risk.

## Level 11: Heavenly Undetection
Your body is like a divine object that none shall harm, not even the gods themselves. 

You cannot be targeted by the sure-hit effect of a Domain Expansion and cannot be detected by one while inside it (e.g., if you are trapped in a domain that forces you to make a Constitution saving throw as its sure hit, you won’t have to make the saving throw). 

You may also pass freely through barriers made of cursed energy without suffering any ill effects.

However, this does not apply to sure-hit effects that target objects or creatures without cursed energy, such as Malevolent Shrine.

Additionally, you gain 1 Object Awareness, and whenever you gain Object Awareness, the amount you gain is doubled. If you gain Object Outline Awareness, you also gain Soul Outline Awareness.

## Level 15: Perfected Fighting Style
You have mastered your fighting style. 

All of the fighting styles you chose are upgraded to their perfected versions:

- ***Perfected Blind Warrior.*** You have blindsight with a range in meters equal to 6 times your proficiency bonus. Within that range, you can see invisible targets and anything that isn't behind total cover or hidden from you.

- ***Perfected Classical Swordplay.*** While wielding a finesse weapon and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to your attack rolls and AC, as long as you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.

- ***Perfected Deadeye.*** You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

- ***Perfected Dual Wielding.*** When you take the Attack action while two-weapon fighting, you can make the single bonus attack with your off-hand weapon as part of your Attack action, instead of using your bonus action. This attack adds your ability modifier to the damage and is made with advantage.

- ***Perfected Great Weapon Fighting.*** You add your proficiency bonus twice to damage rolls with heavy weapons.

- ***Perfected Heavyweight Fighting.*** While wielding a heavy melee weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls and have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to shove.

- ***Perfected Lightfoot Fighter.*** While wielding a light melee weapon, you gain +20 to your walking speed and do not provoke opportunity attacks from the last creature you attacked on your turn, as long as the attack was made with a light weapon.

- ***Perfected Point-Blank Shooter.*** When you make a ranged attack against a target within 1 meter of you, you have advantage on the attack roll. Additionally, when you make an opportunity attack, you can replace your melee attack with a ranged attack.

- ***Perfected Protector.*** When a creature you can see hits you, or a target within 1 meter of you, with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus +1 to the target's Armor Class against that attack. You must be wielding a shield or a melee weapon.

- ***Perfected Sharpened Shot.*** You gain a bonus to damage rolls with ranged weapons equal to twice your proficiency bonus.

- ***Perfected Improvised Fighting.*** When wielding an improvised weapon, you increase its damage die tier by 2.
