As a Jujutsu Sorcerer, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Cursed Energy
Your training has granted you control over the cursed energy within you. 

`Charisma` is your cursed energy modifier for any cursed energy-powered features. 

You have a number of cursed energy points equal to twice your Jujutsu Sorcerer level plus your `Charisma modifier`, as shown in the cursed energy column of the [Jujutsu Sorcerer table](class-traits#class-table). You can spend these points to fuel various features.

You regain all spent cursed energy after a `Long Rest`.

Some applications of cursed energy require the target to make a saving throw to resist the effect. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

### Cursed Energy Save DC 
`8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

### Cursed Energy Attack Roll
`Your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

## Level 1: Cursed Technique or Sorcerer Path
You can choose between being born with or without an innate technique. 

Choose either a Cursed Technique or a Sorcerer Path.

### Cursed Technique 
Cursed Techniques are unique abilities ingrained into the user's body, specifically in the right prefrontal cortex of the brain. Most jujutsu sorcerers manifest their innate technique around the age of five or six, and over time, this technique continually shapes and carves its formula into the user. 

You must choose one innate technique from the options detailed under [Cursed Techniques](/cursed-techniques). 

Every innate technique grants you a specific Cursed Technique, which offers a variety of uses.

- Anything that prevents you from casting spells, such as an Antimagic Field, also prevents you from using innate techniques unless they are in their Reversal or Maximum Output forms.
- Techniques typically require somatic and verbal components to cast, represented as "S" (somatic) and "V" (verbal) followed by a number. For "S," the number represents the number of free hands required (e.g., "S-1" means one hand), and for "V," it represents the number of free mouths required.
- When a technique’s action cost is reduced to a free action or lower, you may reduce its "S" by 1. At the DM’s discretion, you may lower its "V" by 1 at the cost of increasing "S" by 2.
- If a technique requires physically touching something to be used, its "S" cannot go below 1.

### Sorcerer Path
You were born without an innate technique. However, this hasn't stopped you from pursuing your ambitions as a sorcerer, and you've adapted in your own way. 

You must choose a [Sorcerer Path](/sorcerer-paths), which will be detailed in the Sorcerer Paths section below. 

Your choice grants you features at 1st, 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 20th levels.

## Level 1: Unarmored Defense
While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals : 

`10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier`

## Level 1: Unarmored Movement
Your speed increases by 2 meters while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. 

This bonus increases as you reach certain Jujutsu Sorcerer levels, as shown in the [Jujutsu Sorcerer table](class-traits#class-table). 

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling.

## Level 2: Cursed Energy Enhancement
You begin to focus your cursed energy to better manipulate it and have the option to learn one of the following techniques:

### Cursed Strike
Before you make an unarmed strike, you may spend up to your proficiency bonus in cursed energy to empower your next strike. This enhancement lasts until you hit a creature with your unarmed strike or until a minute passes. 

On a hit, you deal additional necrotic damage equal to 1d8 per point spent. Depending on your Innate Technique, your additional damage changes to a specific damage type. You can also use this in response to rolling a natural 20 on an attack roll with an unarmed strike, or landing a black flash, instead of beforehand. 

You can only use this enhancement again after it has ended.

### Cursed Armor
On your or another creature's turn, and for an amount of cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier (no action required), you can surround yourself with cursed energy for one minute. 

You gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of cursed energy spent times 5 for the duration. You can only benefit from this feature again after 1 minute or having your temporary hit points reduced to 0. 

Depending on your Innate Technique, you also gain resistance against a specific damage type while these temporary hit points last. If you cannot take actions, you cannot use this enhancement. 

The temporary hit points value increases to 10 instead of 5 at 11th level.

### Cursed Weapon Enhancement
As a bonus action, you can spend cursed energy up to your proficiency bonus to enhance a melee weapon you are wielding for 1 minute. 

Whenever you hit a target with the weapon, it takes extra necrotic damage equal to twice the amount spent. Depending on your Innate Technique, your damage bonus changes to a specific damage type. You can only use this enhancement again after 1 minute has passed.

If you use this enhancement 25 times or more to the same weapon, it becomes a Semi-Cursed Tool as long as it's not already a cursed tool.

## Level 2: Cursed Martial Arts
Your jujutsu training has taught you advanced martial techniques. 

You can now use any of the following Cursed Martial Arts:

### Cursed Blast of Blows
Immediately after taking the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 3 cursed energy to perform two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

### Cursed Patient Defense
You can spend 3 cursed energy to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

### Cursed Wind Step
You can spend 3 cursed energy to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled until the end of your turn.

## Level 2: Martial Arts
You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed and not wearing armor or wielding a shield.

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.

- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. This die changes as you gain Jujutsu Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the [Jujutsu Sorcerer table](class-traits#class-table).

- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike or attack with a one-handed weapon as a bonus action.

- You gain access to Sorcerer Weapons. You may use your martial arts damage die instead of the Sorcerer weapon damage die if you choose to do so.

## Level 3: Jujutsu Schools
You have started learning from a jujutsu school or teacher to improve your cursed energy. 

Choose between Tokyo Jujutsu High, Kyoto Jujutsu High, Hiroshima Jujutsu High, Ainu Jujutsu High, or Sendai Jujutsu High.

<Note>
	This choice will have repercussions when you unlock the [Level 7: Advanced Studies or Advanced Sorcerer Training](lvl7-advanced-studies-or-advanced-sorcerer-training) feature and the [Level 14: School Graduation](lvl14-school-graduation) feature. Choose wisely!

You cannot increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Alternatively, you may choose to ignore this increase and instead gain a [Cursed Feat](/feats) that you meet the prerequisites for.

## Level 5: Binding Vow
<Note>
	Because binding vows offer a lot of creative freedom, many custom vows could become inherently unbalanced without the DM’s oversight. To address this, we've created a list of [Binding Vow rules](/binding-vows/binding-vow-rules) to help the DM know what to watch for, and to guide players in building their vows more fairly.
</Note>

You can create a binding vow with a willing creature or yourself, entering into a strict contract formed by Jujutsu. 

At any point, you can create one binding vow and choose one of the vows listed in the [Binding Vows](/binding-vows). 

During a combat encounter, once per round, you can make a Binding Vow (no action required).

You can have a maximum number of binding vows equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier, with a minimum of 2 at a time. 

During a Short or Long rest, you can end a number of Binding Vows equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

## Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. 

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 17th level.

## Level 6: Curse-Empowered Strikes
You begin to focus more cursed energy into your strikes or your weapon. 

Your attacks with weapons or unarmed strikes, whichever you choose when you gain this feature, now count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances and immunities to damage from nonmagical attacks. 

You may also add an extra necrotic damage die to the total damage of your choice, depending on your Charisma modifier.

|Jujutsu Density|Damage Dice|
|:-:|:-:|
|If your Charisma modifier is +1|d4|
|If your Charisma modifier is +2|d6|
|If your Charisma modifier is +3|d8|
|If your Charisma modifier is +4|d10|
|If your Charisma modifier is +5|d12|

Depending on your Cursed Technique, the extra damage die may change to a specific damage type.

At 11th level, attacks with the option you didn't choose at 6th level are now also considered magical.

## Level 7: Advanced Studies or Advanced Sorcerer Training

Choose between Advanced Studies or Advanced Sorcerer Training.

You may only treat immunities as resistances a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before needing to take a long rest.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hiroshima Jujutsu High">
	You have been honing your use of cursed creations, and this has granted you the ability to create tools. After focusing on normal objects for 1 hour, you can turn them into Cursed Tools. You learn how to create one of the following Cursed Tools:

	- ***Weapon.*** You enhance the weapon greatly, making it deadly enough to cut through even evil spirits. Attacks with the item deal additional necrotic damage equal to its damage dice + your Charisma modifier. If a creature is killed by a cursed weapon, it cannot be turned into undead or revived by any means other than true resurrection or wish.

	After the alteration, the item becomes a grade 4 cursed tool.
</Accordion>

	- ***Durable Cursed Armor.*** Your armor now grants you resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage.

## Level 7: Resistant
Your strength as a sorcerer allows you to resist certain area effects. 

Choose one of the following ability scores

|Ability|Effect|
|:-|:-|
|Strength|Brawn|
|Dexterity|Evasion|
|Constitution|Endurance|
|Intelligence|Discernment|
|Wisdom|Intuition|

You can only choose the option associated with a certain ability score if you have a 16 or higher in that ability score. If none of your ability scores except Charisma are at or above 16, you may only choose the one that is your highest, or any of your highest in the case of a tie.

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a saving throw using the chosen ability score to only take half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

At 20th level, you can choose one additional saving throw.

## Level 9: Cursed Energy Recovery
Due to extended periods of use, your cursed energy constantly recovers from the adrenaline of battle. 

While in combat, you regain 1 cursed energy at the beginning of your turn, up to your maximum. 

The combat must be one where your life is at risk.

## Level 11: Creative Energy Usage
Due to your extensive use of cursed energy, you have learned more creative ways to utilize it. 

You gain one of the following feats:

- [Cursed Energy Concealer](/feats/cursed-energy-feats#cursed-energy-concealer)
- [Cursed Energy Tracker](/feats/cursed-energy-feats#cursed-energy-tracker)
- [Cursed Energy Ray](/feats/cursed-energy-manipulation-feats#cursed-energy-ray)
- [Cursed Energy Slash](/feats/cursed-energy-manipulation-feats#cursed-energy-slash)

If you acquire all 4 of these feats, you may select another [Cursed Energy Feat](/feats/cursed-energy-feats) that you meet the requirements for.

## Level 11: Exorcise
You've learned to eliminate weaker cursed spirits without expending effort or energy. 

As an action, you can automatically destroy a cursed spirit within 10 meters of you that you can see, as long as its CR is equal to or lower than half of your proficiency bonus (rounded down).

## Level 13: Maximum Output or Explosive Blow
Choose between Maximum Output or Explosive Blow.

### Maximum Output
You have learned to use your maximum output, channeling the highest possible cursed energy into your techniques. As a bonus action, you can spend cursed energy equal to the original cost of one of your Lapse, Reversal, Extension, or Maximum techniques twice. The first time you pay this cost, any reductions that apply to the technique are applied. The second time, no reductions are applied. This amplifies the cursed energy output, granting two of the following benefits the next time the technique is cast:

- ***Increased Range and Area of Effect.*** The technique's range and area of effect are increased by half of its original range (rounded up). This does not apply to touch-based techniques.

- ***Increased Damage Dice.*** The technique's damage dice is increased by half of its original damage dice or bonus (rounded up). For example, a technique that deals 10d10 damage would add 5d10 damage to the total.

- ***Increased Bonus to Hit.*** The technique's bonus to hit is increased by half of its original bonus (rounded up). For example, a technique with a +7 to hit would add +4 to hit in its maximum output form.

- ***Increased DC.*** The technique's DC is increased by half of your proficiency bonus (rounded up).

- ***Increased Duration.*** The technique's duration is increased by half of its original duration. For example, a technique that lasts 1 minute would last 1 minute and 5 rounds.

You cannot choose the same benefit twice.

### Explosive Blow
Certain sorcerers, while not grasping the concept of Maximum Output, have honed their focus on releasing an explosive burst of cursed energy. 

As a bonus action, you can concentrate to channel a condensed portion of your cursed energy into either your limbs or a weapon for 8 cursed energy. 

For 1 minute after you perform this bonus action, your next melee attack adds half of your attack’s damage dice (rounded down) as extra damage to the damage roll. If you take damage from any source during this time, you must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher, to maintain concentration.

Alternatively, as a bonus action when you land a melee attack, you can expend 10 cursed energy to add half of your attack’s damage dice (rounded down) to the damage roll.

For 14 cursed energy (instead of 8 or 10), your melee attack with this feature will add the full damage dice of your attack, rather than just half, to the damage roll.

When you land a successful melee attack that benefits from Explosive Blow, the target is knocked back a number of feet equal to either your attack’s ability modifier or Charisma modifier, times 10, in a direction of your choice. 

If the target collides with an unsecured object or structure, both the creature and the object or structure take 1d10 bludgeoning damage for every 1 meter the creature had left to travel after impact (up to a maximum of 10d10). 

If the target is another creature, they take damage equal to half of your attack’s damage roll instead.
