Jujutsu Sorcerers are individuals secretly trained and employed by the government of Japan to protect humanity from cursed spirits. 

Humans capable of using jujutsu are commonly referred to as Sorcerers, with the jujutsu prefix often signifying their affiliation with Jujutsu High. Evil jujutsu sorcerers are known as Curse Users, while humans who cannot use jujutsu are called Non-Sorcerers. 

All jujutsu sorcerers receive training in their youth at one of the two jujutsu educational facilities in Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Ainu, or Sendai. There, they are taught about jujutsu and how to use their abilities to exorcise cursed spirits.
