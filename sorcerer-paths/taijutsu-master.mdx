As a Taijutsu Master, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Taijutsu Initiate
You begin learning the fundamentals of mastering Taijutsu. 

You unlock the Jujutsu Sorcerer's Martial Arts feature earlier, with your unarmed strike damage die starting at a d4 and progressing according to the table as normal. 

Additionally, you gain the Cursed Strikes feature, and whenever you spend Cursed Energy on it, it counts as if you spent double the amount. However, this still cannot increase the number of dice beyond your proficiency bonus.

Finally, whenever you choose a Taijutsu feat, you can ignore one of its prerequisites.

## Level 3: Specialized Cursed Martial Arts
You learn special types of martial arts and can choose one of the following. At 6th and 10th levels, you can choose another Specialized Cursed Martial Art.

### Divergent Fist
You struggle to control your cursed energy, but when you strike, the effect is delayed and unpredictable. 

Once per round, you can choose to focus until the end of your turn. When you hit a target with a cursed strike while focusing, make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a success, the cursed strike’s damage is delayed, and you can choose to have the damage take effect at any point within the same turn. 

When the damage detonates, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, nothing happens. On a failure, you gain advantage on all melee attacks against the creature until the beginning of your next turn, and your critical hit range is reduced by 1 against them.

Once the damage detonates, you stop focusing. The DC for this technique drops to 10 at 10th level or earlier if you unlock the Black Flash feat. If an attack is benefiting from Divergent Fist, it cannot trigger Black Flash.

### Taido Martial Arts
You can use the Cursed Blast of Blows, Cursed Patient Defense, or Cursed Wind Step Cursed Martial Arts without expending Cursed Energy once per turn.

### Manji Kick
Once per round, as a reaction to a melee attack being made against you, you rotate your body downward, avoiding the attack and delivering a powerful kick to your opponent's face in one fluid motion. 

The attacker’s attack is made with disadvantage, and if the attack misses and the attacker is within your reach, you may make an unarmed strike against them. 

If the unarmed strike hits, you can use the shock of the kick as an opening to make another unarmed strike against them.

### Jab
You deliver a quick, precise strike to create an opening. 

Once per round, when you make an unarmed strike, you may perform a jab. This attack deals half damage but forces the target to react, giving you a strategic advantage.

If the jab hits, your next melee attack against the same target before the end of your next turn is made with advantage. If the jab misses, your next melee attack is made normally, but the target does not gain an opportunity attack against you if they normally would.

### Liver Shot
A precise body blow that weakens the opponent. 

Once per round, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you may spend 2 cursed energy to force them to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they have disadvantage on their next melee attack or Dexterity-based ability check.

### Sweep Kick
You target the opponent’s legs to knock them off balance. 

Once per round, when you make an unarmed strike, you may spend 2 cursed energy to attempt a sweep kick. On a hit, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage. On a failure, they are knocked prone. If they are already prone, they take extra damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

### Renewal Taekwondo - Bo-Bup
Your speed creates the illusion of teleportation. 

As a free action when you use Cursed Wind Step, you may spend an additional 3 cursed energy to activate Bo-Bup. Instead of normal movement, you instantly appear in an unoccupied space within your movement range, ignoring opportunity attacks. If you move at least 10 meters, you gain one of the following effects until the start of your next turn:
- Phantom Step: You gain a +2 bonus to your AC, and if an enemy misses an attack against you, you may use your reaction to move 1 meter without provoking opportunity attacks.
- Mirage Image: You leave behind an afterimage. The next melee attack against you is made with disadvantage.

### Cursed Blast
You momentarily break through your sorcerer limits. 

Once per round, for 3 cursed energy, you can raise the limit of one Cursed Strike to double your proficiency bonus.

## Level 6: Cursed Rain of Blows
Your martial prowess is evident. 

As a free action, after you have taken Cursed Blast of Blows on your turn, you may spend cursed energy up to half of your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to make a number of unarmed strikes equal to the amount spent, with a maximum of 3.

Additionally, your Cursed-Empowered Strikes may scale with your Strength or Dexterity modifier instead of your Charisma. 

Finally, you can choose and pick a Taijutsu feat that you meet the prerequisites for.

## Level 10: Superhuman Combat
Your martial abilities have reached an extraordinary level, and you can now choose three of the following features:

### Deflective Shockwave
As a reaction to a creature entering your range or a ranged attack being made against you, you punch the ground violently, creating a powerful shockwave in both the air and ground. 

Every creature in range must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking an amount of damage equal to your unarmed strike damage and falling prone on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. 

Additionally, you gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Strength modifier against the ranged attack that triggered this reaction. You can add cursed strikes to this damage as normal, and the range of this ability is 2 x (the number of damage dice of the cursed strike + 1) meters. 

If you spend the maximum amount of energy on the cursed strike, you can choose any number of creatures in the area to avoid the effect.

### Strong Throw
In place of an attack, for 3 cursed energy, you can choose a creature or object up to 1 size category larger than you within your unarmed strike reach and make an Athletics check contested by their Athletics or Acrobatics (their choice), or a set DC for objects (5 for tiny, 7 for small, 10 for medium, 15 for large, 20 for huge, and 25 for gargantuan). 

On a success, you can throw the creature or object up to 20 meters, dealing Xd6 bludgeoning damage to them and anyone in the path who fails a Dexterity saving throw, where X is your Strength modifier times the creature or object's size category above small (minimum of 1). 

The dice become d8s if the target is large, d10s if huge, and d12s if gargantuan. The cost increases to 4 cursed energy if the target is large, 5 if huge, and 6 if gargantuan.

### Glancing Blows
Once per turn, as a reaction for up to your Charisma modifier in cursed energy, when you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from an attack or effect you can see, you can reduce it by your Dexterity modifier times the amount spent (to a minimum of 1). 

If you reduce the damage to 1, you can make an unarmed strike with advantage against the attacker if they’re within your reach as part of the same reaction.

### Striking Rush
As an action for 5 cursed energy, you enter a stance of readiness and full attention until the beginning of your next turn. 

Every time a creature enters your reach, you may make an unarmed strike against them (maximum once per creature per round). These attacks only trigger when the creatures move into you or when you move into them, your choice when using this skill. 

During this period, you can make these attacks a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier.

### Triple Kick
Once per round, for 4 cursed energy, in place of an attack on your attack action, after making a running long jump toward the creature you're attacking and landing within your unarmed strike reach, you may instead make 3 unarmed strikes against the creature, performing three swift kicks as part of the same motion.

Depending on the number of attacks that hit, you gain the following effects until the end of your turn:

- 1 or less: Your next X unarmed strikes against the creature will have disadvantage.
- 2: Your next unarmed strike will have advantage against the creature.
- 3: Your next X unarmed strikes will have advantage against the creature.

X equals half of your proficiency bonus (rounded up).

You may not use cursed strikes or any effects on the 3 unarmed strikes used for Triple Kick. Cursed Empowered Strikes still apply.

### Cursed Stomp
At the beginning of your turn, you may reduce your movement speed to 6 meters until the end of the turn, and for the duration, all of your unarmed strikes become downward stomping kicks. 

If you attack a creature that is prone, your critical hit radius is reduced by 1. However, whenever you miss an unarmed strike, you will stomp the ground, causing your unarmed strike to hit the ground and expending any features on your unarmed strike that would normally be expended (such as cursed strikes). 

All creatures within a 1-meter radius, except for you, must make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, they are unaffected. On a failure, they take half the damage of your unarmed strike.

### Double Palm Strike
As a bonus action for 5 cursed energy, you may deliver a double palm strike to an enemy’s gut, staggering them briefly. 

Make an unarmed strike against a creature within range. On a hit, the creature is pushed back 3 meters and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, they are unaffected. On a failure, their movement speed is reduced by a number of meters equal to your proficiency bonus times 5 (to a minimum of 1) until the end of their next turn, and they cannot benefit from any increase to their speed during this time.

### Running Drop Kick
Once per round, when you make an unarmed strike on your attack action, you may spend 5 cursed energy to force the creature to make a Strength saving throw. 

On a success, they are unaffected. On a failure, they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 6 meters moved immediately before the unarmed strike and are pushed directly back a number of meters equal to 1 meter for every 6 meters moved. A creature automatically succeeds the saving throw if they did not take any damage from the unarmed strike. 

The damage from this feature cannot exceed 10 damage dice.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Perfected Martial Combat
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Whenever you use a Cursed Strike, any cursed energy spent is treated as if you spent quadruple the amount. 

This still cannot add more dice than your proficiency bonus.

Additionally, you may choose an additional Superhuman Combat or Specialized Martial Art.

## Level 20: Cursed Adrenaline Rush
When you are at your lowest, you discover a way to fill every inch of your body with immense cursed energy, sustaining it as a last resort. 

At the beginning of your turn, if you are at or below half your hit points, you can choose to activate Cursed Adrenaline Rush. 

For 1 minute, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your maximum hit points, your movement speed doubles, you no longer need to spend cursed energy on your Cursed Strikes, and either your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 4, along with its maximum. 

You can use this feature once per long rest. At the end of this period, you must make a DC 30 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you gain 3 levels of exhaustion.
