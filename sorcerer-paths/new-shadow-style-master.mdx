As a New Shadow Style Master, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Simple Domain
You have learned the basics of the New Shadow Style, the Simple Domain, and gained the New Shadow Style: Simple Domain cursed feat. 

Trained to master this style, your refinement point gain is doubled, and your refinement cap is increased to 125, instead of the base 100. 

Once you reach at least 100 refinement, you gain the following additional benefit:

### Perfected Simple Domain
If a spell or cursed technique is used by a creature with a level or CR lower than your Jujutsu Sorcerer level, your Simple Domain treats all damage from it as if it were resistant to that damage. This does not include domain expansions.

Additionally, while your Simple Domain is active, you can choose to spend cursed energy up to your proficiency bonus to increase its range by 1 meter for each point of cursed energy spent, with no action required. Your damage threshold for Simple Domain is also higher, reducing damage overflow to 1/4 instead of the usual 1/2.

### Simple Domain Programming 
At 11th level, you have learned to impart certain commands into your Simple Domain, potentially causing it to move automatically in response to specific conditions. Work with your DM to determine the effects of any programming you’d like to install in your Simple Domain.

For example, you could program your Simple Domain to automatically intercept anything that enters it, allowing you to use Evening Moon Sword Drawing without spending a reaction, instead paying cursed energy.

## Level 3: Batto Sword Drawing
You have learned how to execute the fastest technique of the New Shadow Style. 

As an action, for 4 cursed energy, while your Simple Domain is active, you may enter the Batto Sword Drawing stance. Additionally, you may open your Simple Domain and pay its cost as part of this action. 

While in this stance, you cover your weapon with cursed energy and automatically attack any projectile or creature that enters your Simple Domain’s range. You can make a number of attacks up to your Dexterity modifier per round.

If targeted by a projectile, you may make an attack roll against it. If your attack roll is equal to or higher than that of the projectile, it misses. If your attack roll is lower, the projectile hits. If a creature enters your Simple Domain, you can automatically attempt to hit it. 

On a hit, you deal your weapon’s damage and an additional amount of necrotic damage equal to the weapon's damage dice. This necrotic damage may vary depending on your cursed energy type, and you may make multiple attacks against the same creature. 

This effect lasts for 1 minute, as long as you spend an action each turn to maintain the stance, or until your Simple Domain ends.

This technique can only be used while wielding a martial melee weapon with the finesse property.

## Level 6: Improved Batto Sword Drawing
Training your technique has enhanced your Batto Sword Drawing technique.

While wielding a martial finesse weapon, you can activate Batto Sword Drawing without needing a Simple Domain, as an action for 5 cursed energy. 

Each time a creature enters your reach on your turn, you may make one weapon attack roll against that creature. 

You can attack a number of creatures up to your Dexterity modifier. On a hit, you deal your weapon’s damage and an additional amount of necrotic damage equal to the weapon's damage dice. 

You may use your movement on your turn to approach creatures and bring them into your reach, and this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

Additionally, constant practice with your Simple Domain has allowed you to abandon the vows required to use it. You gain the Vowless Simple Domain Cursed Feat once you have 75 Simple Domain refinement, or whenever you reach that amount.

## Level 10: Evening Moon Sword Drawing
You have learned one of the most hidden but also one of the most powerful techniques in the New Shadow Style arsenal. 

You may enter the Evening Moon Sword Drawing stance as part of casting your Simple Domain or as an action while within it, and while wielding a martial melee weapon with the finesse property. 

Both methods of activation cost 8 cursed energy and last for 1 minute or until your Simple Domain ends. While in this stance, any cursed energy feature from a creature other than you that originates within the Simple Domain, targets a creature within it (including you), or targets the Simple Domain has its damage dice tier decreased by one. If the feature does not involve dice rolls, its damage is reduced by your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier. 

Additionally, any cursed energy feature you use while in this stance has its damage dice tier increased by one, or if it does not involve dice rolls, its damage is increased by your proficiency bonus.

Whenever a creature makes a ranged attack roll targeting your Simple Domain or any creature within it (including you) while you are in this stance, you may use your reaction to attempt to intercept it. Roll a melee weapon attack with a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier. If your attack roll equals or exceeds the attack roll of the creature, the attack misses.

This technique can also be used offensively. If any creature is within the range of your Simple Domain, you can use an action to move up to your movement speed towards them and make a number of attacks equal to double your Dexterity modifier. On a hit, you deal your weapon’s damage and an additional amount of necrotic damage equal to the weapon's damage dice.

Lastly, constant practice with your Simple Domain has allowed you to imbue it into objects. You gain the Simple Domain Imbuement Cursed Feat once you reach 100 Simple Domain refinement, or whenever you obtain that amount.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Moonlight Veil
You have mastered the ability to swiftly imbue or reinforce a weapon in the heat of battle. 

As a bonus action, you may spend 2 cursed energy to infuse a weapon with Moonlight Veil.

For 1 minute, the imbued weapon is treated as a cursed tool of one grade higher than its original rank for the purposes of damage, durability, and reductions (minimum: Grade 4, maximum: Grade 1). 

Additionally, if the weapon was broken prior to being imbued, it temporarily ignores any penalties associated with its damaged state for the duration.

You may only maintain Moonlight Veil on one weapon at a time.

## Level 20: Perfected Style
You have reached the pinnacle of the New Shadow Style, surpassing limits no one could have imagined. 

If the creature you target with your Batto Sword Drawing has a passive Perception lower than your Dexterity score, the attack roll will add your proficiency bonus again.

Additionally, Evening Moon Sword Drawing can now be used against Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws that would overlap your Simple Domain’s area. If your attack roll equals or surpasses the DC, the saving throw will not affect anyone within the Simple Domain.
