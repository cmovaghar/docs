As a Cursed Energy Manipulator, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Manipulation Expert
Your manipulation of cursed energy has always exceeded expectations, even early in your career as a sorcerer. 

Whenever you use a feature that allows you to spend cursed energy, you may spend 1 additional cursed energy on it.

Additionally, you gain the Cursed Energy Manipulator feat. If or when you acquire the Cursed Weapon Enhancement, you will also gain the Cursed Projectile feat.

Finally, whenever you take a Cursed Energy Manipulation feat, you may ignore 1 prerequisite, provided it is not a level requirement.

## Level 3: Mastered Basics
Through learning and constant practice, you have mastered the basics, allowing you to maximize their potential. 

Whenever you use any of your Cursed Energy Enhancements, they gain the following benefits:

***Cursed Strike.*** Whenever you use a cursed strike, its damage tier increases by one.

***Cursed Armor.*** While your cursed armor is active, you regain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus at the start of your turns. These temporary hit points cannot exceed the maximum amount of armor you can have.

***Cursed Weapon Enhancement.*** Whenever you attack with a weapon enhanced by cursed weapon enhancement, your reach increases by 1 meter.

## Level 6: Creative Manipulations
You have discovered new ways to use your cursed energy, turning simple techniques into more complex ones. 

You gain a Cursed Energy Manipulation feat of your choice, as long as you meet the prerequisites.

Additionally, you gain one of the following creative manipulations. At 10th and 14th level, you can choose another creative manipulation.

### Multiple Energy Slashes
You gain the Cursed Energy Slash cursed feat. 

When using your cursed energy slash, you may spend the cost of it again up to a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus to create extra lines in different directions, based on how many times you spent the initial cost. 

A creature is only affected once if it is within the area of multiple slashes.

### Cursed Energy Nuke
You gain the Cursed Energy Ray cursed feat. 

When using your cursed energy ray and spending the maximum amount of energy, it becomes a cursed energy nuke. Its range becomes 20 meters, and its 5-meter circle turns into a 10-meter cylinder. It also deals three times as much damage to objects and structures, plus your Charisma modifier in additional damage. 

At 11th level, it deals four times as much damage to objects and structures and twice your Charisma modifier. At 17th level, it deals five times as much damage to objects and structures and three times your Charisma modifier. At 20th level, it deals six times as much damage to objects and structures and four times your Charisma modifier.

### Cursed Energy Pressure
You have learned to exude cursed energy from your body, creating powerful pressure around you. 

As an action, you can spend cursed energy equal to your Charisma modifier to force all creatures within a 1-meter radius for each energy spent to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 1d10 necrotic damage, plus 1 additional die for each energy spent, and are knocked prone. On a successful save, creatures take half as much damage and are not knocked prone. 

At 11th level, the initial damage increases to 2d10. At 17th level, it increases to 3d10. At 20th level, it increases to 4d10.

### Stored Energy

During a short or long rest, you can spend one of your hit dice to gain temporary cursed energy equal to the result rolled plus your Charisma modifier. 

These temporary cursed energy last until the end of your next short or long rest and cannot be restored by the Cursed Energy Recovery feature. 

At 11th level, you add +1 to the result. At 17th level, you add +2. At 20th level, you add +3.

## Level 10: Otherwordly Efficiency or Otherworldly Reinforcement
Choose between unlocking Otherworldly Efficiency or Otherworldly Reinforcement.

### Otherwordly Efficiency
You are considered a top-tier practitioner of cursed energy economy, able to spend far less than the average sorcerer. 

Every time you spend cursed energy on a feature, it counts as if you have spent twice as much, though the maximum amount you can reach remains unchanged. 

Additionally, you reduce the amount of cursed energy spent on any features by half of your proficiency bonus (rounded down, to a minimum of 1). This feature does not apply to cursed techniques.

At 17th level, you reduce the cost by your full proficiency bonus. At 20th level, this also applies to cursed techniques.

### Otherworldly Reinforcement
You are considered a top-tier practitioner of cursed energy reinforcement, able to enhance your body far beyond the average sorcerer. 

You gain the Cursed Enhanced Body cursed feat, and the bonus it adds to your attack and damage rolls is increased to your full Charisma modifier.

At 17th level, you may now use your Charisma modifier plus half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down) for both the bonus to your attack and damage rolls and the limit on how much you can spend to add to your saves with Cursed Enhanced Body. At 20th level, the limit on how much cursed energy you can spend on your cursed energy enhancements increases by 1.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Perfect Enhancement
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned how to perfectly enhance your body. 

You gain the Cursed Enhanced Body cursed feat. If you already have this feat, you instead gain the Cursed Energy Reinforcement feat.

## Level 20: Master of Manipulation or Master of Enhancement
Choose between unlocking Master of Manipulation or Master of Enhancement.

### Master of Manipulation
Your efficiency, potency, and versatility surpass any sorcerer ever known.

When you use any feature that consumes cursed energy, you can choose to reduce its action cost by 1 (e.g., full turn action -> action -> bonus action -> free action; you gain one additional free action just for using that feature). If this reduction applies to a reaction, you gain 1 additional reaction for using it. You may only gain an additional reaction once per round per feature. 

Additionally, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier when using a cursed energy feature (that is not a cursed technique) to increase its DC by the amount spent.

Furthermore, you gain the Flawless Fundamentals feat. You can also use this feat to cast a feature with 0 cursed energy a number of times equal to 2 + twice your Charisma modifier before needing to take a long rest.

### Master of Enhancement
Your reinforcement and enhancement are beyond anything any sorcerer has ever seen. 

As long as you have at least 1 cursed energy, you passively gain the maximum benefits of Cursed Enhanced Body for all saves to which it applies. 

Additionally, the cost of your cursed energy enhancements is reduced to 1, regardless of how much they would normally cost.

Finally, you gain the Cursed Energy Reinforcement feat, or Dense Cursed Energy if you already have it. Cursed Energy Reinforcement now increases your armor class by your full Charisma modifier instead of only half.
