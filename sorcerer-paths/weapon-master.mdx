As a Weapon Master, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Weapon Specialist
You gain the Cursed Weapon Enhancement option. 

When you use your Cursed Weapon Enhancement, it will count as if you had spent twice as much cursed energy as you actually spent, though you still won’t exceed the amount allowed by your proficiency bonus.

Additionally, whenever you calculate the DC for a feat that uses or can use a weapon, you can use your Strength or Dexterity score (your choice) instead of Charisma.

Finally, whenever you select a Weapon Feat, you can ignore one prerequisite.

## Level 1: Fighting Style
You have grown accustomed to fighting in a particular way due to your training with weapons, acquiring your very own fighting style. 

Choose one of the following fighting styles. Whenever you gain an ability score increase, you may choose to change your fighting style to another one of your choice.

- ***Blind Warrior.*** You have blindsight with a range in meters equal to 2 times your proficiency bonus. Within that range, you can see invisible targets and anything that isn't behind total cover or hidden from you.

- ***Protector.*** When a creature you can see hits you or a target within 1 meter of you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to the target's Armor Class against that attack. You must be wielding a shield or a melee weapon.

Your ranged attacks with ranged weapons ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 10 meters of you.

- ***Sharpened Shot.*** You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls you make using ranged weapons.

Additionally, at 10th level, your fighting style improves. You can only perfect one fighting style you've unlocked, and can change it whenever you switch fighting styles.
