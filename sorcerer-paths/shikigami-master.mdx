As a Shikigami Master, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Shikigami Collector
You have roamed far and wide in search of Shikigami, earning the title of "Shikigami Collector."

You gain the Shikigami Summon cursed feat, allowing you to choose a Shikigami with a CR equal to or lower than your level.

Additionally, for every level you gain in this class, you gain the Shikigami Summon feat again. Whenever you make an ability check to find or tame a Shikigami, you may reduce the DC by your proficiency bonus.

The distance at which you can summon your Shikigami is 10 meters.

The number of Shikigami you can command is equal to your Charisma modifier.

At 6th level, you become an expert at taming Shikigami. You may now choose Shikigami with a CR equal to your Jujutsu Sorcerer level plus your Charisma modifier.

## Level 3: Quicker Summons
With practice comes experience, and with that experience, you’ve become better at drawing your Shikigami out. 

You can now summon Shikigami as a bonus action instead of an action. 

Additionally, you can summon a number of Shikigami at once equal to your Charisma modifier.

## Level 6: Synergistic Summoning
You’ve learned to decrease the time between summoning and commanding your Shikigami. 

When you summon your Shikigami, you can command them as part of the same action. The action will be either complex or simple, depending on how the Shikigami is summoned. 
- If you summon it with an action, you can give it a complex command.
- If you summon it with a bonus action, you can give it a simple command.

## Level 10: Shikigami Coordination
Your Shikigami have become better at following your orders, forming a great team. 

Whenever one of your Shikigami is within 1 meter of another one of your Shikigami, it gains advantage on its attack rolls. You also benefit from this trait when you're next to your Shikigami.

In addition, you have become better at coordinating with your Shikigami. All of your tamed Shikigami gain the following feature:

***Protector.*** As a reaction to your Shikigami’s summoner being targeted by an attack roll while they are within movement speed range of the Shikigami, the Shikigami may move to be within 1 meter of their summoner and switch the target of the attack to themselves.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Improved Summons
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You’ve learned your Shikigami’s potential.

Whenever you summon one of your Shikigami, you can spend additional cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier to add a bonus to their Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores equal to the energy spent.

You have also learned to supplement your focus on maintaining your summons with your own cursed energy. Anytime you would need to make a concentration check to maintain your summon, you may instead pay cursed energy equal to the creature’s CR to keep it summoned.

## Level 20: Efficient Summons
You have mastered the art of Shikigami summoning. 

The cursed energy required to summon each Shikigami is halved (rounded down), and whenever you summon a Shikigami, you may use a free action to immediately summon another one with a CR equal to or lower than 1/4 of the first one’s.
