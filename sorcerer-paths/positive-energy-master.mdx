As a Positive Energy Master, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Beginner Healer
You have been born with a great aptitude for healing others, despite never truly studying medicine. 

You gain the Reverse Cursed Technique feat. Your reverse cursed technique is stronger than normal, with every 1 cursed energy spent counting as 2.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill. If you are already proficient, you gain expertise instead. Whenever you make a Medicine check to stabilize someone and succeed, the creature regains 1 hit point.

## Level 3: Good As New
Due to constant usage of your Reverse Cursed Technique, you have honed your healing abilities, making the wounded feel rejuvenated. 

You gain the Improved Reverse Cursed Technique and Improved Output feats. 

Whenever you heal a creature, they gain temporary hit points equal to half the amount of hit points healed. They cannot gain temporary hit points from this feature again until the current temporary hit points are lost. 

Additionally, your reverse cursed technique healing pool is increased to 15 times your level, multiplied by your Charisma modifier.

Furthermore, the constant flow of reverse cursed technique energy through your body has accelerated your cursed energy recovery. You now regain your cursed energy during a short rest.

## Level 6: Recovery Enhancer
Wounds have become a simple matter for you. 

Whenever you spend at least 10 cursed energy in your Reverse Cursed Technique, you can choose to end one of the conditions currently affecting the target or reduce one level of exhaustion. 

For each additional 10 cursed energy spent, you can remove one condition or reduce one additional level of exhaustion. This feature cannot remove external conditions, such as restrained or grappled.

## Level 10: Perfect Body
Due to the constant flow of positive cursed energy through your body, you have become healthier than almost every creature in the world.

Your body becomes immune to disease, and whenever you make a Constitution saving throw or check, you can spend 1 cursed energy to grant yourself advantage on the roll.

Additionally, your DC to force Reverse Cursed Energy is now 15.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Beyond Their Limit
Your studies at Tokyo Jujutsu High have taught you how much greater your healing can be, not only aiding others but also enhancing their capabilities beyond their normal limits. 

Whenever you heal a creature with reverse cursed technique, you may spend an additional 5 cursed energy to make the creature feel a surge of energy in their body. They will gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Their movement speed increases by 3 meters.
- They can take an extra bonus action.
- They gain resistance to all damage except psychic.
- Their damage rolls will count as if they have spent the maximum amount of cursed energy on Improved Output.

After the surge ends, the creature must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, their body suffers backlash from the energy, causing them to gain 5 levels of exhaustion. On a successful save, they still experience some strain but only gain 1 level of exhaustion.

## Level 20: Resurrection
You have learned to utilize the output of Reverse Cursed Technique to such a degree that you can bring people back from the brink of death. 

As an action, for 25 cursed energy and 1600 hit points from your Reverse Cursed Technique pool, you can touch a creature that has died within a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier, restoring them to life and healing all wounds they suffered. This cannot heal wounds beyond the limit of what can be healed with the Improved Output feat, such as lost limbs or injuries that exceed what Reverse Cursed Technique can normally heal. The creature returns to life with 0 hit points and is considered stable.

This cannot be used on a Cursed Spirit or any creature that cannot ordinarily be healed by Reverse Cursed Technique.

Additionally, you can use this ability to heal your own body and resurrect yourself from death while still within the window of your Reverse Cursed Technique. If you have died within a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier multiplied by two, you may spend 35 cursed energy and 1200 hit points from your Reverse Cursed Technique pool to heal your wounds and resurrect yourself, regaining 1 hit point.

You cannot heal from wounds that cannot ordinarily be healed by Reverse Cursed Technique, such as a destroyed skull, neck, or torso, significant brain damage, or death caused by extreme means, as determined by your DM.

If you possess the Reverse Cursed Technique Mastery Boon, the window in which you may heal yourself extends to a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier multiplied by two.
