As a Barrier Master, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Barrier Specialist
You have mastered the art of barriers, specializing in them. You gain the Basic Barrier feat. 

Additionally, the amount of cursed energy you can spend into a barrier increases by your proficiency bonus. As a Barrier Master, you can also alter certain properties of your barriers, such as choosing which side will be more resistant to damage.

Furthermore, whenever you take a Barrier Technique feat, you may ignore one prerequisite that does not require another feat. This feature cannot be used to obtain Domain Expansion unless you already possess an Innate Technique.

<Note>
	If you are using the Sorcerer Path with an Innate Technique and you have a Domain Expansion, you cannot alter the properties of the barrier within your Domain Expansion without the necessary refinement points.
</Note>

## Level 3: Complex Barriers
With your time spent in the field, youâ€™ve learned a few tricks for manipulating barriers. 

Whenever you use a basic barrier, you may spend a full turn action to open it and gain one of the following effects. 

At 6th level, you may apply two effects to a barrier by extending its casting time by the duration of the second property. For example, if you were to cast a barrier with the tracking and looping properties, the barrier would take at least two full turn actions, depending on the number of rooms involved in the looping property. At 12th level, you can apply up to three effects.

Additionally, you can apply two of these properties to Pure and Empty barriers as well. The number of full turn actions will depend on the additional days required, and you must spend an additional amount of cursed energy equal to ten times the level prerequisite of the barrier property. The available properties are listed below.

<Note>
	You and your DM can create custom properties to assign to barriers, with the examples listed below serving as set options that can be used.
</Note>

### Trapping Barrier
*`Prerequisite: 3rd level`*

You cast the barrier at the center of a creature within 5 meters of you. 

The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is trapped in the barrier; on a success, the creature can move enough to escape the barrier's range, as long as it is within its movement speed. 

If the creature lacks enough movement to escape, it is trapped automatically. 

At 5th level, the use of the trapping barrier becomes an action, and at 13th level, it becomes a bonus action. Additionally, this property cannot be combined with any other listed here.

### Disrupting Barrier
*`Prerequisite: 3rd level`*

Whenever you cast a veil or barrier, all creatures within the area are unable to use the Sixth Sense feature for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. 

The use of a Disrupting Barrier grants all creatures advantage on Stealth checks from the Cursed Energy Concealer feat at 5th level and imposes disadvantage on Perception checks from the Cursed Energy Tracker feat at 13th level.

### Selective Barrier
*`Prerequisite: 3rd level`*

You can choose to make the barrier or veil impassable to all but one creature, or make it impassable to just one creature of your choice when you cast the barrier. 

At 5th level, you can apply the effect to a number of creatures equal to half your Charisma modifier, and at 13th level, this increases to your full Charisma modifier.

### Resistant Barrier
*`Prerequisite: 3rd level`*

The barrier has resistance to all damage. 

At 5th level, the barrier gains damage reduction equal to your Cursed DC, and at 13th level, the barrier's AC increases by your proficiency bonus.

### Tracking Barrier
*`Prerequisite: 6th level`*

While the barrier or veil is active, you can choose a number of creatures equal to half your Charisma modifier. 

While these creatures are within the barrier, you are aware of their precise locations. 

At 13th level, the number of creatures whose locations you can track increases to double your Charisma modifier, and at 17th level, it includes all creatures within the barrier.

### Looping Barrier
*`Prerequisite: 9th level`*

When you are within a building, you can choose a number of rooms up to your proficiency bonus to loop between one another in random order. 

These rooms must be connected in some way. For example, you could loop a hallway infinitely and link two rooms to it. 

Whenever a creature enters a door, it may lead to either the hallway again or the other room. 

At 14th level, the number of linked rooms increases to double your proficiency bonus. Additionally, while you are within the barrier, you may choose which room to travel to instead of it being random.

### Chrono Distortion Barrier
*`Prerequisite: 12th level`*

When you cast the barrier, it begins to alter the flow of time for you and all creatures within it. 

While the barrier is active, creatures inside take their turns at an accelerated pace, starting at a 2:1 ratio. For example, one round of initiative outside will pass normally, while inside the barrier, a second round will take place, with only creatures inside taking their turns. 

At 14th level, the ratio becomes 5:1. At 17th level, the ratio increases to the point where any number of rounds can pass inside the barrier, and no time will pass outside.

### Level 6: Barrier Master
Your barriers only grow stronger as time passes. 

You gain additional slots for Binding Vows related to barriers equal to your proficiency bonus plus your Charisma modifier. 

Additionally, whenever you gain refinement towards barrier techniques, such as Domain Expansion or Simple Domain, you gain an additional amount of refinement equal to half your proficiency bonus. 

You also gain the Barrier Master feat.

## Level 10: Superior Barriers
With training and practice, you have learned how to create barriers of exceptional quality compared to normal. 

You gain the Barrier Invader feat.

Additionally, you gain the ability to create the following forms of barriers at the specified levels:

### Pure Barrier
*`Prerequisite: 10th Level`*

The most basic improved barrier. 

When you cast a Basic Barrier, you may choose to extend its casting time to 30 days. During this time, you must expend the maximum amount of cursed energy you could on your Basic Barrier each day while standing in a specific spot chosen at the beginning of the casting, which will be the center of the Pure Barrier. If you fail to repeat this process at any point during the casting time, the casting fails, and all cursed energy spent is wasted. 

Upon successfully completing the casting time, the Basic Barrier is cast as though you spent as much cursed energy as you expended over the course of the 30 days (for example, if your Charisma is 5, and you spent 5 cursed energy per day, the barrier would be cast as though you spent 150 energy). Additionally, its duration becomes Until Dispelled, and it is called a Pure Barrier. 

When you cast the Pure Barrier, you may set an amount of Rules for the barrier up to 1/3 your proficiency bonus (rounded down to a minimum of 1). A Rule is an effect the barrier applies either inside of it, in an area outside of it within its radius, or both. 

A Rule can be any effect the DM agrees to, such as doubling the hit points of any barrier cast by any member of a chosen group or collecting ambient cursed energy that would form cursed spirits to change where they appear. You may only have a number of Pure Barriers simultaneously equal to (double your proficiency bonus) - 2.

### Bon Barrier
*`Prerequisite: 15th Level`*

A higher-level improved barrier. 

As an action, you may turn an amount of Pure Barriers into Bon Barriers by spending 30 cursed energy per barrier transformed. 

A Bon Barrier is the same as a Pure Barrier, except there is no limit to the number of Rules it may have. Bon Barriers still count toward the number of Pure Barriers you can have in existence.

### Barrier Network
*`Prerequisite: 20th Level`*

The highest level of improved barrier, a barrier formed by the connection of other barriers. 

Over the course of a long rest, you may establish or alter a Barrier Network. A Barrier Network consists of a collection of straight-line connections between the centers of any number of Pure Barriers and Bon Barriers, with each barrier connected to no more than two other barriers, forming a closed polygon. 

Pure Barriers and Bon Barriers within a Barrier Network may have Rules that affect or pertain to other barriers in the network. 

Any Rule shared by all barriers in the network may be chosen to use the inside/outside of the polygon formed by the Barrier Network instead of the inside/outside of any single barrier. 

For the purposes of reaching outside the polygon, the radius is treated as the furthest distance between the center of the polygon and the center of one of the straight-line connections forming its sides. 

The range which the Rule can reach is multiplied by 10 for each barrier in the network. When creating a Barrier Network, you must choose at least 4 of the barriers in the network, or all barriers in the network if it includes fewer than 4, to be considered "vital" barriers. 

If any of these vital barriers are dispelled or destroyed, all barriers in the network collapse. Additionally, your skill with barriers has reached uncharted peaks. 

All your barriers will always count as if you had spent double the amount of cursed energy you actually spent for their creation. 

This cannot be used to exceed the maximum amount of cursed energy you can spend on a barrier.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - The True Barrier Master
You have learned new uses for your barriers, making them grow in strength. 

Your barriers' hit points and range will both double.

## Level 20: Empty Barrier or Domain Improvisation
Choose between unlocking Empty Barrier or Domain Improvisation

### Empty Barrier
You have learned the ultimate form of barrier, becoming one of the few sorcerers capable of executing it. 

As the name implies, these barriers are nearly vacant within their boundary. Their boundary consists of hexagon-shaped panels that can be freely altered by a skilled barrier technique user. As an action, for 20 cursed energy, you can create a vast empty space that covers a 1.2 km radius. Inside this barrier, the area will be filled with hexagon-shaped panels that you may alter. You may deactivate the Empty Barrier at will. You gain the following lair actions:

***Switch Places.*** You may drop a hexagon beneath a creature, causing it to fall into the hole and reappear somewhere else in the barrier. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks, and due to the unexpected nature of the switch, the first attack made by the creature after being moved will be treated as a surprise attack.

***Barrier Negation.*** You may drop your hexagons, negating any barriers that were being lifted within your own, preventing them from activating. This includes domain expansions, even those without barriers. However, ending a domain that lacks a barrier also requires you to simultaneously end the Empty Barrier.

***Custom Properties.*** Due to the complexity of the Empty Barrier, it can be used to perform actions once thought impossible. Discuss with your DM to create a custom property for your Empty Barrier. For example, you could slow the evolution of an Immortality user.

### Domain Improvisation
Your skill with barrier techniques has allowed you to creatively use them in conjunction with your Domain, turning your own body into the domain.

If you possess the Domain Expansion feat, you may, as a reaction, pay the usual Domain Expansion cost and spend 5 cursed energy to use your barrier techniques alongside your domain, effectively using your body as the domain. This increases your output significantly and activates the domain at a much faster rate.

Your DM has great latitude in determining the effects when your Domain is used in this way, and this technique has limited utility when used offensively.

For example, an offensive technique like Shrine would gain almost no additional benefit, but a technique with a broader target concept, such as Antigravity System, could have a highly useful defensive effect against things like a Black Hole or gravity-based powers.

When used in this way, your domain lasts for one minute and is confined to your body. All other rules of Domain Expansion still apply.
