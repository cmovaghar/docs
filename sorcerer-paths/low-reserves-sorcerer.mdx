As a Low Reserves Sorcerer, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Lower Cursed Energy
You know well that cursed energy isn't your forte, and it shows. 

Your cursed energy amount is now equal to your Jujutsu Sorcerer level + half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down). 

Additionally, any feats that would increase your cursed energy only increase it by half (rounded down).

However, your limited cursed energy has made you harder to track. Whenever someone tries to track you using the Cursed Energy Tracker feat, they do so with disadvantage on their Wisdom (Perception) check.

## Level 3: Perks
Due to your deficiency in cursed energy, you’ve had to find other ways to excel as a sorcerer. 

You gain one of the following perks:

***Sharpshooter.*** You gain a +2 bonus when attacking with ranged weapons.

***Nimble Dodge.*** As a reaction to an attack hitting you, you can reduce the damage by half of your Jujutsu Sorcerer level (rounded down) + your Dexterity modifier.

***First to Act.*** You gain a +3 bonus to initiative rolls.

***Always Alert.*** Your passive Perception increases by +5.

***Defensive Style.*** You add your proficiency bonus to your AC.

***Attentive to Detail.*** You gain proficiency in Perception, or expertise if you are already proficient. You cannot receive disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

## Level 6: Improved Perks
Your perks are your main strength as a sorcerer, and you capitalize on them to the fullest. 

You gain an improved version of one of the perks you picked at 3rd level:

***Sharpshooter.*** You gain a +2 bonus when attacking with ranged weapons, and you no longer receive disadvantage when attacking within the weapon's minimum range.

***Nimble Dodge.*** As a reaction to an attack hitting you, you can reduce the damage by your Jujutsu Sorcerer level + your Dexterity modifier.

***First to Act.*** You gain a +5 bonus to initiative rolls.

***Always Alert.*** Your passive Perception increases by +5, and you cannot be surprised while conscious.

***Defensive Style.*** You add your proficiency bonus to your AC and half of your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to any saving throws you make.

***Attentive to Detail.*** You gain proficiency in Perception, or expertise if you're already proficient. You cannot receive disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, and you gain advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine if someone is lying.

In addition, you gain one additional perk of your choice. However, this perk does not become an improved perk.

## Level 10: Quirks
While your colleagues are discovering new ways to utilize their cursed energy, you're uncovering incredible new abilities within yourself.

You gain one of the following quirks:

***Skilled.*** You become proficient in 4 skills of your choice, or gain expertise in 2 skills you're already proficient in.

***Weapon Specialist.*** You choose one specific weapon type, such as a handgun, a dagger, or a katana. You will add your proficiency bonus twice for attack rolls with that weapon type.

***Attacker.*** You gain one additional extra attack, allowing you to attack three times instead of twice. At 17th level, you can attack four times instead of three.

***Resistant.*** You gain 2 Resistant features of your choice.

***Reactive.*** You gain one additional reaction.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Resourceful
You’ve made sure to maximize your strength. 

You gain one additional quirk and one additional perk of your choice.

## Level 20: Above Average
You know you won't reach greatness with your amount of cursed energy, and that's okay. At the end of the day, all that matters is that you can accomplish your mission. 

You gain one additional action.
