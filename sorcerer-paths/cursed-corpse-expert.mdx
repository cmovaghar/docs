As a Cursed Corpse Expert, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Cursed Corpse Creation
You gain the Cursed Corpse Creator feat, allowing you to create medium and large corpses in addition to tiny and small.

## Level 3: Soul Imbuement
You gain the Soul Imbuement modification. 

When you use this modification on a core, it requires 3 long rests to imbue someone's soul information into the core. To do this, you must have the person readily available or possess a strong memory of them in order to turn their physical information into soul information. 

Once a corpse has been created in this way, it must take 2 weeks to develop before becoming sentient. After these 2 weeks, it gains 1 level in the jujutsu sorcerer class and can progress as if it were a player. 

A corpse with this core becomes sentient and mimics the behavior of the soul it is imbued with, but it does not gain the soul's memories.

## Level 6: Efficient Creation
When creating cursed corpses, the cost of the cores, materials, and body is reduced by half. 

Additionally, it takes one-third less time to create an artificial body.

## Level 10: Abrupt-Mutation Cursed Corpse
You gain the Abrupt-Mutation Cursed Corpse modification. 

It follows the same rules as creating a soul-imbued core, but you must repeat the process 3 times for each core. 

Once the cores have been imbued, the corpse must take 3 months to become sentient. After this time, it gains 1 level in the jujutsu sorcerer class and can progress as if it were a player. 

Each of the 3 cores can also have 1 animal modification imbued into it.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Favorite Creation
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You can choose one cursed corpse that you have created to become your favorite. This favorite corpse gains the following benefits:

- Two of its ability scores are increased by 2, and their maximums are also raised.
- It gains 2 hit points per level.
- Its unarmed damage increases by 1 tier.

## Level 20: Perfect Creations
When creating an Abrupt-Mutation Cursed Corpse or a soul-imbued corpse, you can add cursed energy to the cores to reduce the time it takes for them to gain sentience. 

If you imbue the core with half of its maximum energy, it will reduce the time by half. If you imbue it with the maximum amount of cursed energy, it will reduce the time by three-quarters.
