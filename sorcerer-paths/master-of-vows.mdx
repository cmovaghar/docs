As a Master of Vows, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Vows Knowledge
Through intense studies and practice, you have become highly knowledgeable in the art of binding vows. 

You gain the Binding Vows feature early. 

Additionally, you can create a number of bonus Binding Vows equal to half of your proficiency bonus (rounded down), and these bonus vows do not count towards your total.

At 5th level, you gain the Vows Master feat.

At 11th level, the bonus of vows that do not count towards your total increases to your full proficiency bonus. Additionally, you gain the Favored Vow feat.

## Level 3: It's Never Too Late For a Deal
You are known for your ability to always maintain at least one vow with another person. 

Your solo vows and multiple people vows are now counted separately, allowing you to have 1 + your Intelligence modifier for both.

If you have the Vows Master feat, this limit increases to 2 + your Intelligence modifier, applied twice.

## Level 6: People Pleaser
you know just the right buttons to push to make someone accept your deal.

You have advantage in Persuasion checks to convince creatures to make binding vows with you. You are also able to make vows with non-sorcerers or anyone who has no levels in Jujutsu Sorcerer.

In addition, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, or expertise in case you were already proficient.

At 11th level, you gain expertise if you only have proficiency in Persuasion. 

## Level 10: Devil's Deal
Honesty and good intentions can only take you so far in life, so to reach your objectives, you’ve learned to cheat slightly on your deals. 

You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to convince creatures to make binding vows with you. 

Additionally, whenever you try to convince someone to make a binding vow, the DC is reduced by your Intelligence modifier.

Furthermore, during the creation process of a vow with someone, you can try to add a clause that might be easily broken. After you’ve added this clause, you can make a Deception check to attempt to misguide the other creatures making the vow with you. If you succeed, the creatures are unaware of the clause and might break it by accident. Breaking a multiple-person vow is very dangerous, and the punishment for doing so should be a fitting one, determined by the DM. For example, you could be making a vow with a creature to secretly have them bring you information in exchange for your protection. You might add a secret clause stating that they cannot tell anyone about the deal, and if they fail the check, they are unaware that they cannot talk about it. If they talk about it, they would break the vow.

Finally, you gain proficiency in the Deception skill or expertise if you are already proficient.

At 17th level, if you only have proficiency in Deception, you gain expertise in it.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Wolf in Sheep's Clothing
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You’ve perfected your ability to deceive, leaving no room for error. 

Creatures make Insight checks against you with disadvantage, and you reduce their rolls by your Intelligence modifier.

## Level 20: Nation Control
Your binding vows are spread across a nation, greatly expanding your influence beyond what many can comprehend. 

The number of binding vows you can make becomes unlimited. 

For every 5 binding vows you have with other creatures, you gain a +1 bonus to your Deception and Persuasion skills, up to a maximum bonus of +20.
