## Master and Servant
*`Requires two or more different Jujutsu Sorcerers`*

You have a deep admiration and respect for someone, so much so that you can restrain yourself to obey them. One member of the vow will be the "master," while another will be the "servant."

The servant will receive one of the following restrictions, as decided by the master:

- The servant's maximum Cursed Energy is reduced by an amount chosen by the master.
- The servant's technique's range is reduced by a number of meters decided by the master (cannot go lower than 1 meter).
- The servant's technique's damage is reduced by a number of damage dice chosen by the master (cannot go lower than one die).
- The servant cannot use Simple Domain or Barrier.

The servant will remain under this restraint until the master allows them to unleash their Cursed Energy as an action. Upon doing so, the servant gains one of the following benefits, depending on their restriction:

- Their Cursed Energy maximum doubles (counting the original value without the reduction), and they regain Cursed Energy equal to the amount they lost.
- Their technique's range doubles (counting the original value without the reduction).
- Their technique's damage dice double (counting the original value without the reduction).

This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the master's proficiency bonus, after which this vow can only take place after a long rest.
