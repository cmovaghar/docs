<Note>
	All of the binding vows here are examples. You may create your own binding vows in collaboration with your DM. 
	
	Make sure to check out the [Binding Vow Rules](/binding-vows/binding-vow-rules).
</Note>

## Favorite Enemy
You spend 1 hour preparing to fight against a creature you know. During this time, you create a vow and choose one creature as your "favorite enemy." Afterward, you gain one of the following benefits for your cursed techniques:

- You have advantage on attack rolls against the chosen target.
- The target’s saving throws against your cursed techniques are reduced by your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus.

However, any other creature besides your "favorite enemy" adds their proficiency bonus to saving throws against your cursed techniques (even if they have already done so). Additionally, your melee cursed energy attack rolls and ranged cursed energy attack rolls will have disadvantage against them.

When used while a barrier technique is active, creatures not chosen as your "favorite enemy" cannot pass through the barrier, while the chosen creature can pass through it freely.

Even if you take this vow multiple times, you cannot choose the same creature more than once.

## Worst Case Scenario
*`Requires Curtain or Domain Expansion to utilize`*

You have one creature you fear above all others, and you must ensure it does not interfere with your plans. 

You choose one creature you know or have heard of, making it your "Worst Case Scenario." 

Whenever you cast a Curtain or Domain Expansion, that creature cannot forcibly enter the barrier unless it destroys it. However, any other creatures will be free to pass through the barrier.

## Cursed Energy Battery
You can accumulate a portion of your cursed energy into an object, which becomes your battery. 

This battery can store up to twice your maximum amount of cursed energy, but it can only be charged once per day at the start of the day. 

You can send an amount of cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus into the battery. Any cursed energy sent into the battery cannot be replenished until the next day.

Once the battery reaches its cursed energy limit or at least half of it, you can use the stored energy as you see fit—whether to fuel a machine or to replenish your own cursed energy. 

You can draw cursed energy from the battery as a Bonus Action, taking any amount of cursed energy you wish, but this cannot exceed your maximum capacity after extraction.

You may take this vow multiple times to create additional batteries.

## Revealing One's Hand
You can reveal part of your innate technique to your opponent in detail, temporarily increasing your cursed energy output. 

As an action, while you are within 15 meters of a creature that can hear you, you can explain how one aspect of your cursed technique works. 

You must choose one feature of your technique, such as an extension technique. After you explain it, that specific technique feature gains the following benefits when used against creatures who heard your explanation:

- Your cursed technique damage dice increase by 1.
- Your cursed technique attack rolls add your proficiency bonus an additional time.
- The cursed technique cost is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1).
- Your cursed energy DC is increased by your Charisma modifier.

However, the creature now understands how your technique works, granting it advantage on saving throws against that specific cursed technique feature. Additionally, any melee cursed energy or ranged cursed energy attack rolls made against that creature are done with disadvantage.

After the battle, creatures that heard your explanation become immune to Revealing One's Hand, meaning the DC and damage of your cursed techniques will no longer be increased against them. They are also immune to this binding vow if they already knew how your technique works before the vow was activated.

Creatures do not need to understand your explanation—only to hear it for this vow to take effect.

## Overtime
You despise working overtime, which led you to vow to avoid it. 

You must choose a specific set of time that represents your "Job" (determine with your GM), lasting for 8 hours. During these 8 hours, your powers are limited, and you suffer the following effects:

- Your Cursed Energy maximum is reduced by your Charisma modifier.
- Your melee and ranged cursed energy attack rolls will not add your Charisma modifier.
- The damage die of your cursed techniques is reduced by one tier.

Once the 8 hours pass, you enter overtime. For a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus, you lose the above restrictions and gain the following benefits:

- Your Cursed Energy maximum is increased by your Charisma modifier.
- Your melee and ranged cursed energy attack rolls gain a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier.
- The damage die of your cursed techniques is increased by two tiers.
- You regain Cursed Energy equal to your Charisma modifier at the start of each of your turns.

After this effect ends, you must return to your "working shift" before it can take effect again.

## Final Sacrifice
You have discovered that you can sacrifice your own life in exchange for a massive boost in power, either for yourself or for another creature with whom you share a meaningful connection. 

This vow can also be imposed on a creature you directly control. When you use any feature fueled by cursed energy that requires an action (Action, Bonus Action, Reaction, etc.), it will be powered by your life force, and the feature will gain all the relevant benefits:

- Damage is doubled.
- A cursed energy attack roll will automatically be considered a hit and a critical, regardless of the roll or AC.
- Any saving throw required by this feature is automatically failed.
- The feature does not require any cursed energy to use (except for features involving Reverse Cursed Energy).

You remain alive only until the next feature is used, after which your body completely disintegrates, and you cannot be revived in any way. If a minute passes after the vow is initiated and no feature is used, you must reinstate the vow to keep it going.

Alternatively, you can shorten your lifespan to just 1 minute remaining and gain 2 of the following benefits:

- Attack and damage bonuses are increased by your proficiency bonus, added twice.
- Temporary hit points equal to half your maximum hit points.
- Temporary cursed energy equal to half your maximum cursed energy.
- AC is increased by your proficiency bonus.
- A +5 to your DC.
- Additional cursed energy can be spent on features equal to your Charisma modifier.
- Conditions or effect durations are doubled.
- Damage reduction equal to half your level.

Once the minute begins, it cannot be stopped. If you die early, all effects end immediately. These benefits can also be applied to another creature with whom you share a connection. After the minute passes, you die and cannot be revived by any means.

## Rapid Technique Activation
You need to use your cursed technique immediately but can’t meet the usual activation requirements, so you make a vow to use it without them. 

By creating this vow, you can immediately use a technique that you know as either a reaction or free action, bypassing all other requirements except the cursed energy cost. However, this comes with a permanent consequence:

For all subsequent uses of that technique, you must either:

- Increase the action cost of the technique by 1 (free action → bonus action → action → full turn action), or
- Add an additional requirement or prerequisite to use the technique (for example, needing Chanting to be active to use the technique).

The increased action cost or additional requirement/prerequisite lasts even if you end the vow during a short or long rest, as the technique has been permanently altered.

You may take this vow multiple times, but each time it must apply to a different technique.

## Simple Domain Conditions
*`Requires you to have a Simple Domain`*

You have customized your Simple Domain to impose special conditions, adding unique rules that apply within it. 

These conditions can take various forms depending on the vow you create. Below are examples:

- **Example 1:** You create a vow that establishes a non-violence condition within your Simple Domain. Combat cannot begin until a specific question is answered. Once the question is answered, the battle may proceed as normal. The Simple Domain will last until the question is resolved.

- **Example 2:** You create a vow that transforms your Simple Domain into a small sumo ring. If a creature accepts your challenge for a sumo match, both of you are teleported to a dimension where only the sumo ring exists. You fight until one of you falls unconscious, causing the Simple Domain to vanish. This Simple Domain lasts for an undefined number of rounds, and time inside the domain passes slowly—while only a minute may pass in the outside world, an hour passes within the domain. The Simple Domain will remain until the offer to fight is declined or until one sumo fighter wins.

## Barrierless Domain
*`To use this, you must have a domain expansion, 1000 refinement points, and the Barrier Master feat`*

Your domain expansion has reached its highest level, achieving something that many sorcerers cannot even comprehend. 

You can now use the options available for Barrierless Domains.

## Maximized Destruction
*`Prerequisites: Idle Transfiguration, Instant Spirit Body of Distorted Killing feature`*

To maximize your destructive potential, you have made a vow to keep your body still in exchange for increased durability. When Instant Spirit Body of Distorted Killing is active, you gain the following benefits:

- Instant Spirit Body of Distorted Killing gains hit points equal to your Charisma modifier multiplied by 40.
- You cannot use Self Alteration on your head, torso, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg, or body slots.

You are still able to use Idle Transfiguration.

## Self-Altered Tendrils
*`Prerequisites: Idle Transfiguration, Maximized Destruction Vow`*

Because your vow prevents alterations to your body, you have placed a separate vow on your tendrils, allowing you to still transfigure them effectively. 

The tendrils from Instant Spirit Body of Distorted Killing count as a body slot for the purpose of Self Alteration’s weapon and shape alterations.

## 106'000 IQ Play
*`Prerequisites: Boogie Woogie innate technique, must be attuned to a Prosthetic Vibraslap`*

You’ve made a binding vow, turning what you once believed would hinder your technique—the loss of a hand—into a blessing. 

When you use Boogie Woogie as a reaction, you may spend additional reactions to empower the swap. 

For each additional reaction, your swapping range increases by 10 meters, and for every 5 additional reactions, you may choose one additional target for the swap. 

When swapping more than two targets, you can decide which targets are sent to which positions.

## Preheated Furnace
*`Prerequisites: Shrine innate technique, Furnace - Open feature`*

You have crafted a vow to overcome your furnace's greatest weaknesses.

Outside of your domain, *Furnace - Open* becomes an action and is treated as a ranged cursed energy attack roll against one creature within 4 times the amount of energy spent in meters. 

Inside your domain, it targets all creatures within the domain, excluding yourself, and deals bludgeoning damage as a second instance of damage to any creature it hits, as long as the domain has a barrier that prevents at least non-living things from leaving. 

This bludgeoning damage ignores resistance and instantly kills any creature reduced to 0 hit points by it.

## Limited Copy
*`Prerequisites: Vengeful Cursed Spirit innate technique, Copy feature`*

When you attempt to copy a creature who is of a higher level or CR than yourself, you can make them count as lower by sacrificing the number of times you can use the technique. 

When you use this vow and copy, you can treat all creatures as equal to your level or CR, but you may only use the copied technique a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. 

You are still subject to all the normal rules of Copy when using this vow, such as healing preventing your copied technique from working and being unable to copy certain features. 

You can choose not to use this vow when attempting to copy a cursed technique.

## Soul Dismantle
*`Prerequisites: Shrine innate technique, 81 or more Soul Knowledge`*

When you make a dismantle, you can now reduce its range to touch and make a melee cursed energy attack roll while using it. 

If you do this, every attack you land forces the trapped soul to make a Charisma saving throw for Soul Separation. 

You no longer need to roll 5 or more above the vessel’s AC.

<Note>
	This vow can be customized to work with other cursed techniques. Work with your DM to create a variation that allows other techniques to target the soul.
</Note>

## Resonance Conduit
*`Prerequisites: Straw Doll Technique innate technique, Resonance feature`*

You can now transfer all the Soul Harming damage of Resonance from a Cursed Object to the Cursed Object itself. 

However, while using Resonance, you lose the ability to harm the Cursed Object in any other way.

## Lure Gambit
Sometimes you underestimate how much damage an attack will deal. In such cases, you can use this impromptu vow to increase your chances of survival. 

When you take damage from an attack, you can vow away the cursed energy that would be used to protect a limb and direct it to the rest of your body.

As a result, a limb will be reduced to 0 hit points, but the temporary hit points from cursed armor are doubled. The destroyed limb is either one targeted by the limb system or a random limb if the limb system is not in use. 

The DM will choose which ranked limb is destroyed based on the method of attack.

## Final Gimmick
*`Prerequisites: Construction Technique, must be at least 6th level`*

Your technique allows you to create almost any grade of tool, opening up many interesting possibilities. However, it cannot create special grade tools, so you’ve made a vow to give up your essence in exchange for their creation.

You can now use Cursed Constructions to make special grade tools, but for every cursed energy spent this way, BEFORE any cost reductions, you take 4d12 necrotic damage that bypasses resistances, immunities, reductions, thresholds, and temporary hit points. 

Additionally, your maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. Any cost increased by the Cursed Energy Deficiency feature counts towards this damage.

You regain your lost maximum hit points during long rests. For each long rest, you regain an amount of maximum hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. You cannot create another special grade cursed tool as long as you're still recovering lost maximum hit points.
