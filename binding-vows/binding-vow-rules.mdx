Binding vows can be incredibly powerful, especially when players push the limits while creating them. To maintain balance, here are some key concepts to watch out for when dealing with binding vows:

## 1. Togglable Binding Vows
A player might suggest a binding vow that can be turned on or off at will. For example: "I am a limitless user, and I want my blue save DC to be increased by my Charisma modifier, but it can only affect one creature at a time. However, I can turn this vow on and off, so I don’t suffer any drawbacks."

This undermines the concept of binding vows because the player isn’t truly sacrificing anything if they can simply toggle the effects off. However, if the player possesses the Vow Master feat, this rule can be enforced more leniently, as they’ve studied vows and can be more flexible with their design.

## 2. Not Actually Giving Up Anything
A player might propose a binding vow where their melee-focused character gains advantage on all melee attack rolls but takes disadvantage on every cursed energy attack roll. If the character isn't reliant on CE attacks, this isn’t a genuine trade-off and doesn’t qualify as a fair vow.

## 3. More Cursed Energy Cost
A player might suggest a binding vow where they increase their cursed energy save DC in exchange for a higher cursed energy cost. While this may seem reasonable at first, it can quickly become unbalanced. Depending on the boosted feature, it could result in abilities with impossibly high save DCs that can end encounters instantly.

## 4. Reaction Negation
A player might propose a binding vow that removes the ability for reactions to affect their cursed energy feature. This should be automatically rejected, as reactions are a core mechanic, and removing them entirely disrupts the balance of play. It bypasses most defense mechanics and creates an unfair advantage.

## 5. Mimicry
A player might suggest a binding vow that allows their technique to mimic a feature from another technique. This should be denied outright, as it often doesn’t make sense logically and can quickly become overpowered.

## 6. Death Saving
A player might suggest a binding vow just as their character is about to die, such as: "I lose all my cursed energy and fall unconscious, but my technique automatically activates, teleporting me miles away." This is unbalanced and effectively acts as a "get out of jail free" card, with no real consequences for the player.

## 7. Rule Breaking
A player might propose a binding vow that completely ignores the established rules of their technique. For example: Idle Transfiguration transforming creatures into primitive forms, or Limitless being only able to teleport once per turn. The rules of the technique exist for a reason and should not be broken by binding vows. However, sometimes a vow that breaks your technique’s rules can be acceptable if the downside heavily outweighs the benefits.

## 8. Refinement Increasing
A player might propose a binding vow that increases their domain refinement. This should never be allowed. Not only is it overpowered, but it doesn't make sense lore-wise. Binding vows amplify a sorcerer’s physical abilities, cursed techniques, or cursed energy, but domain refinement is based solely on expertise in constructing a barrier.

## 9. Metagaming
A player might suggest a binding vow their character couldn’t possibly know about. For example: a character without the Barrier Master feat or levels in the Barrier Master class creating a complex vow for a barrier. An example: "I vow that my barrier is reverse triangle-shaped, and any objects with cursed energy can't pass through it at a certain time of day, but the HP of the barrier is reduced by 30 each round and its cursed energy cost is increased by half the original cost." This goes against the character’s established abilities and knowledge and should be avoided.

## Binding Vows and PVP
Many Dungeon Masters using this supplement run games with player versus player (PVP) combat. Incorporating binding vows in PVP scenarios can be tricky and often leads to frustration for both sides. One of the best solutions is to simply remove the usage of binding vows during PVP. If this approach doesn’t work for your group, remember that Dungeons & Dragons is primarily a Player versus Environment (PVE) game. While PVP can work in this supplement, adding binding vows into the mix can often ruin the fun and balance of a PVP match.
