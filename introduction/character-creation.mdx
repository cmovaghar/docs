## Step 1: Choose your Race
Your character's race defines their origins, physiology, and how they interact with the world of Jujutsu Kaisen. From ordinary humans to supernatural beings, each race offers a unique perspective on the dangers and conflicts of the jujutsu world.

  <Card
    title="Human"
    href="/races/human/human-traits"
  >
    The most common race in the world of Jujutsu Kaisen, humans have no inherent supernatural traits. However, some are born with innate techniques or exceptional cursed energy control, allowing them to become powerful sorcerers. Others rely on sheer determination and training to survive in a world filled with curses.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Cursed Vessel"
    href="/races/cursed-vessel/cursed-vessel-traits"
  >
    Cursed Vessels are the result of incarnation, a process where the remains of a sorcerer become a cursed object that is later ingested by another person. In most cases, the original sorcerer completely takes over the host’s body, retaining their knowledge and skills while gaining access to the host’s memories. Cursed Vessels often bear unusual markings or unnatural features as a sign of their transformation.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Cursed Spirit"
    href="/races/cursed-spirit/cursed-spirit-traits"
  >
    Born from the negative emotions of humanity, cursed spirits are supernatural entities made entirely of cursed energy. Most are monstrous, mindless creatures that terrorize humans, but the most powerful among them can take humanoid forms, speak, and even form alliances. Ordinary humans cannot perceive or touch cursed spirits, making them one of the greatest threats in the world.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Cursed Corpse"
    href="/races/cursed-corpse/cursed-corpse-traits"
  >
    Cursed Corpses are artificial beings created by jujutsu sorcerers through a combination of cursed energy and a core infused with a soul. While some resemble animals or machines, others take on more human-like forms. Though they are independent and capable of thought, their personalities often reflect the habits or intentions of their creator. Some cursed corpses even have multiple cores, allowing them to switch between different personas or abilities.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Death Painting"
    href="/races/death-painting/death-painting-traits"
  >
    The result of forbidden experiments conducted by the infamous sorcerer Noritoshi Kamo, Death Paintings are half-human, half-curse hybrids. Originally sealed away as cursed objects, they can incarnate by fusing with a human host, regardless of the host’s natural affinity for jujutsu. Once reborn, they possess a unique mix of human intelligence and cursed spirit abilities, making them dangerous and unpredictable.

Each race brings its own strengths, weaknesses, and lore. Choose wisely—your race will shape your character’s abilities, struggles, and identity in the world of jujutsu.

## Step 2: Choose your Background
Choosing a background is a crucial step in shaping your character’s story and motivations. It defines where you come from, your connections, and the experiences that have shaped you. 

It influences how you interact with the world around you and the goals you strive to achieve. Your choice will guide your role in the story and open up new opportunities for growth, conflict, and discovery.

With your DM's permission, when choosing a background you may also pick a [Background Feat](/feats/background-feats).

## Step 3: Choose your Class
In the world of Jujutsu Kaisen, power comes in many forms. When creating your character, you must choose between two distinct classes, each shaping how you fight and survive in the dangerous world of Jujutsu Sorcery.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Jujutsu Sorcerer"
    href="/classes/jujutsu-sorcerer/class-traits"
  >
    Wielders of Cursed Energy, Jujutsu Sorcerers harness supernatural power to battle against curses and other sorcerers. This class offers over 60 different Innate Techniques, each granting a unique way to manipulate Cursed Energy, from controlling space itself to summoning powerful shikigami. For those born without an Innate Technique, there are 7 Sorcerer Paths—alternative methods of mastering jujutsu through intense training and specialization.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Heavenly Restriction"
    href="/classes/heavenly-restriction/class-traits"
  >
    Stripped of Cursed Energy at birth, those with a Heavenly Restriction possess raw physical might beyond human limits. Their bodies are faster, stronger, and tougher than any ordinary warrior, rivaling the power of sorcerers through sheer natural talent. With unmatched combat instincts and heightened senses, they embody the pinnacle of physical perfection, proving that strength alone can stand against even the most fearsome curses.

## Step 4: Make it yours
Your character is more than just their abilities—they have a story, a purpose, and a reason for fighting. This final step is crucial: creating a backstory that ties together your choices and brings your character to life.

- **Why did you choose this path?** Were you born into a prestigious sorcerer family, inheriting a powerful Innate Technique? Or did you develop your skills through sheer will, training relentlessly to overcome your weaknesses?
- **What drives you?** Are you seeking revenge for a loved one lost to a Curse? Do you fight to prove your worth, or are you simply following orders from the Jujutsu Society?
- **How do you fit into the world?** Your character isn't just an isolated warrior; they have connections, allies, and enemies. Work with your DM to integrate your backstory into the game’s world, making it feel natural and meaningful.

This step is where your character becomes truly unique. Whether you're a cursed prodigy struggling with your own immense power or a Heavenly Restriction fighter proving that raw strength can defy fate, your story is what makes your character unforgettable.
