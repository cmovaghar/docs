As a user of the Gravestone Technique, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Walking Plague
Your cursed energy is as infectious as the plague. When you use Curse-Empowered Strikes, Cursed Strikes, or Cursed Weapon Enhancement, you can choose to change the damage type to poison instead of necrotic damage. Additionally, whenever you use Cursed Armor, you gain resistance to poison damage.

## Level 1: Domain Expansion - Tombstone of Plague
Your technique is unlike any other, operating through a lethal domain. Your Domain Expansion costs no cursed energy the first time you cast it. However, the cursed energy cost increases by 10 each time you cast the domain, up to a maximum of 30. This increase resets after you complete a long rest. Additionally, you may expand your Domain as a bonus action, instead of its normal action cost. Once your domain ends, you enter burnout as usual.

Your domain reflects a graveyard in a forest dimly illuminated by the moon. The gravestones across the yard provide half-cover.

Coffin, Grave, Countdown, and the saves they require are the sure-hit effects of this domain. If the effects of the sure-hit are prevented from occurring, you cannot target that creature with the next feature. (For example, if a creature trapped in a coffin uses Simple Domain, you cannot use Grave on them.)

### Coffin 
At the beginning of each creature's turn, the hostile creature with the highest amount of cursed energy is trapped inside a coffin and is considered restrained until they escape. The creature also gains total cover. The coffin has HP equal to half your level (rounded down) times half your Charisma modifier (rounded down) times 3. Its AC is equal to your Cursed Energy DC. You can only have one creature trapped in a coffin at a time.

### Grave
As a Bonus Action or as a Reaction to a creature being trapped inside the coffin, you may spend 5 Cursed Energy to bury the creature under a massive boulder. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take 4d12 bludgeoning damage, or half as much on a success. To escape, they must break both the boulder and the coffin, which now count as one target for the purpose of targeting. The combined structure has HP equal to half your level (rounded down) times your Charisma modifier times 3. Its AC is equal to your Cursed Energy DC.

At 5th level, the creature takes 6d12 bludgeoning damage. At 11th level, it takes 10d12 bludgeoning damage. At 17th level, it takes 14d12 bludgeoning damage.

### Countdown
As a Bonus Action or as a Reaction to a creature being trapped under the boulder, you may spend 5 Cursed Energy to begin counting down. If the creature has not escaped by the start of your next turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 20d10 poison damage, or half as much on a success. The creature repeats this saving throw at the end of its turns, taking the same damage on a failure. If the creature is immune to disease or poison and is a living creature, it instead takes half as much damage.

While a creature is trapped, you count as though you’re concentrating. If you wish, you may release a creature from the coffin and grave without using an action. If the creature you’re targeting uses Simple Domain or Hollow Wicker Basket, the amount of time they have left to escape is halted and will only resume once they stop using it. The DC for the concentration saving throw is 10 or 1/4 of the damage taken, whichever is higher.

## Level 3: Infectious Disease (Technique Improvement)
You’ve increased the lethality of your technique, allowing you to manifest its capabilities elsewhere. You can now use Coffin, Grave, and Countdown outside your domain. They work the same as they would within your domain, but they no longer retain their sure-hit effect. However, they have a range of 10 meters, and the functions of Coffin are slightly altered.

***Coffin.*** As a bonus action for 4 cursed energy, you can force a creature of your choice within range to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, nothing happens as they dodge the coffin. On a failure, they are restrained for 1 minute, allowing you to use Grave and Countdown when needed.

A creature may make a Strength saving throw at the beginning of their turns to escape the Coffin, or they can escape if the coffin is destroyed.

## Level 6: Grave Robbing (Technique Improvement)
You’ve improved the capabilities of the Grave, making it extremely hard to defend against. When you use Grave outside your domain, you may spend 4 cursed energy to force creatures to make the Strength saving throw for its damage with disadvantage.

Additionally, you make the concentration saving throw to keep a creature trapped with advantage.

## Level 10: Dedicated Disease (Technique Improvement)
Your technique has become something worth fearing, and you’ve decided to reduce your enemies' chances of survival. When creatures make the Constitution saving throw to resist your Countdown outside your domain, you may spend 4 cursed energy to force them to make the saving throw with disadvantage.

The damage dealt by Countdown is now increased to 30d10.

***Infectious Dedication.*** Your ability to concentrate using your technique has greatly improved, allowing you to enhance it with cursed energy. When you fail the concentration saving throw, you can spend 1 cursed energy to succeed instead.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - One More Moment (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You’ve realized you’re at a major disadvantage when fighting more than one enemy. 

You can now target an additional creature when using Coffin, although you cannot use Grave or Countdown on that creature.

## Level 20: Mass Death (Technique Improvement)
You’ve improved your technique to its fullest. You can now target up to two creatures when using Coffin, Grave, or Countdown.

## Technique Reversal: Mourning Coffin
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Thanks to your mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked your cursed technique reversal.

As a Bonus Action for 8 Cursed Energy while within your domain, you may place a willing creature within sight into a casket. This creature is considered restrained while inside the casket, and it has total cover until it leaves, which it can do at will. The creature heals 5d10 HP at the start of its turns. The casket’s AC and HP are equal to that of a Coffin. You may only have one creature within a casket at a time.

At 3rd level, as a Free Action for Cursed Energy up to twice your Charisma modifier, you may heal a creature within a casket for 1d10 per Cursed Energy spent.

At 6th level, you can use this outside your domain.

At 14th level, you can have up to two creatures within a single casket.
