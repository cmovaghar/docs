As a user of the Black Bird Manipulation, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Black Bird Manipulation (Lapse Technique)

Your technique has granted you control over Ravens through cursed energy. You can command your Ravens using the Summon Commanding Rules, but the number of Ravens you can control at once is limited to half your sorcerer level (rounded up), rather than the usual limit.

You start with control over three Ravens.

***Acquiring Ravens.*** As an action, you can spend 1 Cursed Energy to force up to a number of Ravens equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) within 20 meters of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they become charmed by you and will obey all of your orders, even if it would harm them. If a Raven is incapacitated in any way, it automatically fails the Wisdom saving throw.

***Raven Sight.*** As a free action, you can close your eyes, gaining the blinded condition unless you have blindsight. In exchange, you can see through one of your Ravens. While seeing through your Ravens, you use your Perception skill and Passive Perception instead of the Raven's. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to sight when observing through your Ravens. Additionally, the sight range of your Ravens doubles while you're watching through them. You can only see through one Raven at a time, and you can switch between them at will. You can stop seeing through a Raven as a bonus action.

***Streaming Service.*** Starting at 5th level, youâ€™ve developed a highly useful and profitable ability. You can touch a device with a screen to imbue it with your cursed energy, which lasts until you choose to end the imbuement (no action required). While a device is imbued, you can make the screen display what one of your Ravens sees. If the device has a speaker, you can also have it play what the Raven hears.

## Level 3: Dark Watch (Technique Improvement)
Your Ravens are always guarding you. While a Raven is within 10 meters of you, creatures cannot gain advantage on attack rolls from being unseen by you, and you gain a +5 bonus to your Passive Perception.

## Level 6: Raven Collector (Technique Improvement)
You are a specialist at collecting Ravens, so much so that they are naturally drawn to you. Ravens now make their Wisdom saving throw to resist your technique with disadvantage.

Additionally, at the end of a long rest, you can roll a d6. The result is the number of Ravens you find during that rest.

## Level 10: Bird Strike (Extension Technique)
Through constant research and study, you have discovered the true potential of your technique. 

You can spend 10 Cursed Energy as an action to order a Raven you're currently controlling to make the Final Choice binding vow, sacrificing its own life for you. You make a ranged cursed energy attack roll against a target within 40 meters. On a hit, the target takes 10d10 force damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are afflicted with the Bleeding condition.

If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this technique, they are killed outright. Additionally, any limbs struck by this technique are instantly severed.

The damage of this technique increases to 12d10 at 11th level, 14d10 at 17th level, and 17d10 at 20th level.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Swarm of the Night (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Your time at Tokyo has taught you that the Ravens are stronger when united rather than acting individually. You can spend 4 Cursed Energy as an action to merge up to 10 controlled Ravens within 20 meters of you into a Raven Swarm.

The Raven Swarm lasts for 1 minute or until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point all Ravens die. The swarm is controlled by you and acts immediately after your turn ends. After the duration ends, all Ravens revert to their individual forms.

You cannot see through your Raven Swarm.

The Raven Swarm uses the Improved Durability variant rule.

Swarm Power: All Ravens in the swarm are empowered by your cursed energy and gain the following benefits:

- They add your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) to their Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores.
- Their flying speed is doubled.
- They add their Dexterity modifier to damage rolls.
- They have the Evasion feature.

***Swarm Cover.*** While you or an ally is within 1 meter of the Raven Swarm, attack rolls against the creature are made with disadvantage.

## Level 20: Darkness Strike (Technique Improvement)
You have perfected your Bird Strike technique to its absolute limit. Your Bird Strike now ignores resistances, though not immunities. Additionally, it bypasses three-quarters and half cover.

## Technique Reversal: Dove Manipulation
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

With your mastery of Reverse Cursed Technique, you have learned the reversal of Black Bird Manipulation. You can now tame Doves or transform Ravens into Doves. As a bonus action, you may turn a number of Ravens equal to your Charisma modifier into Doves, spending 1 Cursed Energy per Raven.

Doves follow the same rules as Ravens but cannot be used for Bird Strike. As part of controlling a Dove, you can spend Cursed Energy up to twice your Charisma modifier to heal a creature within touch range. The creature regains 1d8 hit points per Cursed Energy spent.

While any allies are within 10 meters of a Dove, they have advantage against the Frightened, Berserked, and Bloodlusted conditions. If any allied creatures within range are reduced to 0 hit points or are making death saving throws, they are instead stabilized. Additionally, a Dove can suppress effects causing a creature within range to be Charmed, Frightened, Berserked, or Bloodlusted. If the Dove leaves the 10-meter radius of the creature, any suppressed effect resumes, provided its duration has not expired in the meantime. You can only use this suppression ability once per creature per short or long rest.
