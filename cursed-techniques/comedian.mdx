As a user of Comedian, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Funny Cursed Energy
Your cursed energy has become completely unpredictable. 

Your Cursed Energy Armor now changes based on the damage type of the attack, granting you resistance to it—sometimes for comedic effect. 

Your Curse-Empowered Strikes and Cursed Energy Ray also adapt, changing their damage type according to your opponent's vulnerabilities or to your choice if they don’t have any. 

Additionally, whenever you land an attack infused with cursed energy, it produces a goofy sound effect of your choice.

## Level 1: Comedian (Lapse Technique)
You're so incredibly funny that not even reality can keep up with your comedic power! 

As a free action, you can spend 3 Cursed Energy to activate your Comedian Technique. 

Whenever a creature takes any hostile action against you, you can use your reaction to negate the action (the resources used by the creature are not consumed) and trigger a Comedic Event. Roll a d20 to determine what hilarious situation unfolds next (X is your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus).

|Number rolled|Effect|Description|
|:-:|:-|:-|
|1|Bad Joke|You tell such a terrible joke to all the creatures in battle that it becomes unbearably awkward and out of place. Stones materialize, forming the phrase "bad joke," and fall onto your back, dealing Xd6 bludgeoning damage. You must then make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone from the impact.|
|2|Zombie Apocalypse|You and the creature are suddenly teleported to another dimension, one ravaged by a terrible apocalypse. In this bleak world, it’s just the two of you left, and the creature is suspected of being infected due to its recent coughing and dizziness. Faced with this dire situation, you decide to take drastic action and cut off its arm to stop the infection. This causes Xd12 slashing damage and removes the arm entirely. However, just after you make the cut, you both realize that the creature was never infected in the first place—it just had a common cold!|
|3|A Kitten On The Road!|You spot a kitten in distress on the road and rush to its aid, only to discover that once you reach it, the "kitten" is actually the creature you're facing off against! It then scratches you, dealing Xd6 slashing damage.|
|4|Always Watch Both Sides!|The creature finds itself standing in front of a road, needing to get to the other side. However, it decides it's too cool to look both ways and doesn’t bother to check. Suddenly, a truck, with you as the driver, comes barreling down the road and passes right through them. The creature takes Xd10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone, learning the hard way to be more careful next time.|
|5|Dance Battle!|Both you and the creature are suddenly transported to a disco ballad, where the two of you must dance to determine who’s the best dancer! Both of you roll a Performance check. The creature with the highest roll is declared the winner, while the loser falls into a severe depressive mood, receiving 5 levels of exhaustion until the beginning of your next turn.|
|6|Game Show!|Both you and the creature are teleported to a game show where three questions will be asked. Each of you must make a Dexterity check to see who can press the button faster to answer. Once one creature gets the majority of the questions right, they will be rewarded with a huge fortune in gold bars! But wait—your fortune is so large that the gold bars fall right on top of the loser, dealing Xd10 bludgeoning damage and knocking them prone due to the weight of your newfound wealth!|
|7|Hospital Emergency!|Both you and the creature are teleported to a hospital, where you are the doctor and the creature is the nurse. Together, you rush a patient towards the medical aisle, doing your best to keep them alive. Once you reach the aisle, both of you must roll a Medicine check. If you have the higher roll, the patient is saved, and your nurse is fired for incompetence, becoming stunned until the beginning of your next turn from the shock of being suddenly dismissed. If the creature has the higher roll, it grabs a defibrillator and shocks you, dealing Xd10 lightning damage and leaving you paralyzed until the beginning of your next turn.|
|8|Marriage|Both you and the creature are teleported to a wedding, and it’s the happiest day of your lives. One of you will be the bride and the other the husband (your choice), and you both marry in a beautiful floral setting. The creature is deeply in love with you, and you are in love with it as well. For the duration of the ceremony, both of you are charmed by each other until the beginning of your next turn, completely forgetting about the battle at hand and lost in the bliss of the moment.|
|9|Final Exam|Both you and the creature are teleported to a classroom, where you're alone with a teacher, facing your final test. Neither of you has studied, but you still need to pass. Both of you must roll a Sleight of Hand check against your Cursed Energy DC. On a success, the creature passes the test and avoids summer school! On a failure, the teacher catches them cheating, and they are sent straight to detention, banished until the beginning of your next turn.|
|10|Fun Beach Day!|Both you and the creature are teleported to a beach, standing in the water, enjoying a peaceful day. You’re both splashing water into each other’s faces, having fun in the sun. The battle? Who cares about that right now? For this moment, you both completely forget about the conflict and just enjoy the peaceful scene, doing nothing until the beginning of your next turn.|
|11|Drunk Test|Both you and the creature are transported to a highway, where your car has been pulled over by a cop for speeding. The creature is the cop and will try to check if you're drunk. You must roll a Deception check against its Insight check. If your roll is higher, you successfully lie your way through the test and are free to go, but not before you drink a beer in front of the cop and speed off, making the creature so furious that it becomes taunted by you until the beginning of your next turn. If the creature’s roll is higher, you’re put in handcuffs for drinking under the influence, leaving you restrained until the beginning of your next turn.|
|12|Highschool Crush|Both you and the creature are teleported into a school dining hall, where you're both getting lunch. The creature has a crush on someone at the school, and as their best friend, it's up to you to help them out. You spot the crush sitting alone at a table, and you see this as the perfect opportunity for the creature to make their move. You roll a Charisma check to give your friend some love advice. For every 5 points you score on the roll, the creature gains a +1 bonus to their own check. With newfound confidence, the creature approaches their crush and makes a DC 25 Persuasion check. If successful, the crush agrees to hang out with them, making the creature incredibly happy. This grants them advantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the beginning of your next turn. If the check fails, the creature is knocked prone from the rejection and is stunned by the news until the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, they suffer psychic damage, rolling Xd12, from their broken heart.|
|13|Whacking Moles|Both you and the creature are teleported into a place full of holes, where you have a hammer and the creature is a mole. Both you and the creature must roll a d6. If your roll matches the creature's, you manage to land a hit with the hammer, dealing Xd8 bludgeoning damage and knocking them prone until your next turn from the impact. If you roll a different number, you miss the mole, and the creature bites you, dealing Xd10 piercing damage while making you scream like a little girl.|
|14|The Fraud VS the Strongest|Both you and the creature are teleported to a battlefield, where you are the strongest and the creature is the fraud. You open a domain, and the creature shrinks back in fear. You then say, "Stand proud, [creature's name], you are strong," which forces the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, they understand your message and cry tears of joy, becoming charmed by your greatness until the beginning of your next turn. On a failure, they are frightened by your greatness until the beginning of your next turn.|
|15|Jan-Ken-Pon|You and the creature are teleported to a distance of 1 meter from each other, as you both decided to settle this with a janken dispute. You both roll a d3: 1 is for rock, 2 is for paper, and 3 is for scissors. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The winner of the dispute then delivers a corresponding attack—rock, paper, or scissors—against the opponent. A rock attack deals Xd12 bludgeoning damage, a paper attack deals Xd12 slashing damage, and a scissors attack deals Xd12 piercing damage.|
|16|Sitting on a Full Train|You and the creature are teleported onto a train, where you are sitting down and the creature, who is an old person, is standing up, tired from a long day. You roll a d2. On a 1, you do not give up your seat for the creature, making you feel bad and resulting in a -5 penalty to all your rolls from the shame until the beginning of your next turn. On a 2, you give up your seat so the older person can sit, making you feel extremely good for your kind act. You gain a +5 bonus to all rolls from your good actions.|
|17|Mystery Box!|You and the creature each receive a mystery box and open it to reveal its contents. Both of you roll a d27, with each roll corresponding to a Cursed Tool in the order of the number rolled. The effect of the Cursed Tool lasts until the end of your next turn.|
|18|Special Dinner|You and the creature are teleported to an apartment, where you two are in a relationship, and you made dinner yourself! It's no secret that you're bad at cooking, but you put in extra effort this time for your beloved. The creature looks at the food and thinks it looks unappetizing, but decides to eat it for your happiness. The creature tastes the food and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they vomit from how bad it tastes and are poisoned until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, they manage to gulp it all down, making you pleased. As a result, you cannot attack the creature until the beginning of your next turn due to your satisfaction with their effort.|
|19|Funny Joke|You tell an amazing and well-thought-out joke at the perfect moment. When you deliver it, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to resist bursting out laughing from your peak comedy. On a failure, they start laughing uncontrollably, exclaiming, "Man, I'm dead!" before falling unconscious, lasting until the beginning of your next turn.|
|20|A Partner|You and the creature are teleported to a stand-up comedy venue, where you both are comedians who recently partnered up. Standing before a large crowd, this is the moment you’ve both been training for — the moment you become legends. Both of you must roll a DC 25 Performance check. If one of you fails, the crowd isn't pleased, and the show ends in failure. This leaves you feeling extremely sad and disappointed, but also angry that the creature ruined your moment. You will gain the bloodlusted condition specifically for that creature, lasting for 1 minute. If both of you succeed, the crowd loves the show, and you two become top stand-up comedians. Your heart is satisfied, and you feel fulfilled, knowing you've done what you love most — making people laugh with your partner. Overcome with joy, you lay down on the ground and slowly drift into sleep, falling unconscious for 1 minute. While unconscious, you cannot be targeted by attacks or affected by saving throws.|

None of these comedic moments can reduce a creature to 0 hit points, because killing people is not funny! They may only occur once per creature in a round, as comedy needs its timing, man! You gain additional reactions to activate comedic events equal to your Charisma modifier plus your proficiency bonus.

To keep this active, you must spend 1 Cursed Energy at the beginning of each of your turns, because comedy ain’t cheap, chief! The Comedian feature ends if you become frightened, unconscious, or if you have no Cursed Energy remaining to spend. You may also choose to end it at will. Please note, Comedian and any features relying on it do not function against effects or attacks that cause the frightened condition, nor while you are frightened. Absolute terror truly isn’t funny.

Additionally, due to your expertise in being funny, you gain proficiency in all Charisma-based skills. If you’re already proficient in one of those skills, you gain expertise in it instead. A creature may attempt an Intelligence saving throw against your Cursed Energy DC when an event affects them. On a success, they may turn the event against you, causing you to take the effects of the event. On a failure, nothing happens, and the event affects them as intended.

## Level 3: Master of Humor (Extension Technique)
Your humor is absolute peak comedy—no one can deny that! 

Whenever you or an ally within your sight range fails a saving throw, ability check, or misses an attack, you can use your reaction and spend 4 Cursed Energy to make them reroll it, with a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier.

## Level 6: Ouch! That Hurt Man! (Extension Technique)
Man, that attack definitely hurt! But anyway, you got back up like nothing happened. 

As a reaction to you or an ally within your sight range receiving damage from another creature while Comedian is active, you can spend 8 Cursed Energy to reduce the damage rolled to 0.

## Level 10: Dramatic Pose! (Extension Technique)
You're not only good at comedy, you're also extremely good looking! 

As an action, for 10 Cursed Energy, you strike a dramatic pose that makes every hostile creature that can see you make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you roll a d4 to determine which condition they suffer until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, they lack basic sense of humor and are not in awe of your performance, meaning they don’t suffer any conditions.

|Number Rolled|Condition|
|:-:|:-|
|1|Prone|
|2|Blinded|
|3|Stunned|
|4|Paralyzed|

This condition can be ended early if the creature receives any damage from an outside source, accompanied by a "bonk!" sound effect.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Damn Bro! You Got The Whole Squad Laughing! (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You've realized that you can be even funnier than you are now. 

Whenever one of your Comedic Events occurs, every ally of your choice who can see you gains a "funny die." They can hold onto that die until they take a long rest. 

The funny die is equal to your Curse-Empowered Strikes. They may add the die to their next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw at any time. A creature cannot have more than one funny die at a time.

## Level 20: You Tryna Kill Me?! (Technique Improvement)
Imagine how funny it would be if you got one-shotted... but then simply came back up at full strength! 

Whenever you are reduced to 0 hit points by another creature while under the effects of Comedian, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to get back up with your maximum hit points. This causes Comedian to end.

Additionally, any conditions that were affecting you are removed.

## Technique Reversal: Tragedy
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Because of your mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique and finally waking up to reality, you realize that nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world. The longer you live, the more you understand that the only constant in this reality is pain and suffering.

When Comedian is active, you may spend 3 additional Cursed Energy to reverse the technique, transforming it into Tragedy. A tragedy will occur whenever you make any kind of hostile action against a creature. Roll a d20 to determine what grim future awaits (X is your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus).

|Number rolled|Effect|Description|
|:-:|:-|:-|
|1|Terrible Memory|You remind the creature of a painful event from its past, one that still haunts it to this day. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it takes Xd12 psychic damage and is knocked prone from the emotional pain of the reminder. On a success, the creature is unaffected by the reminder.|
|2|End of the World|You and the creature are in a world-ending scenario, with only the two of you left. You tell the creature it's all its fault, that no one will ever live on the planet again because of its actions. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it takes Xd12 psychic damage and becomes restrained until the beginning of its next turn, as the ghostly hands of all its friends and family grab it and scream for help. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and is not restrained, as it knows it wasn't its fault.|
|3|Road Kill|A cat has just been run over by a truck, and the creature rushes to its aid, only to realize it's too late — the kitten is gone. However, the creature soon realizes the cat was theirs, and before they can mourn the loss of their best friend, the truck door opens. You step out of the truck and smugly say you did it on purpose, forcing the creature to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes Xd12 psychic damage and becomes paralyzed from shock until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, they take half as much damage and are not paralyzed, as they steel themselves from the revelation.|
|4|You Should Have Listened|The creature is with its mother, who tells it to look both ways before crossing the street. The creature ignores its mother's advice and starts walking across the street, but suddenly a car speeds toward them. The creature hesitates, but before it can react, its mother jumps in and pushes the creature to safety, sacrificing her life to save her child. Horrified, the creature watches in shock as the car window rolls down, revealing you. You coldly say, "You should have listened to her," forcing the creature to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes Xd12 psychic damage and is frightened until the beginning of your next turn, overwhelmed by the traumatic experience.|
|5|Alone in a Party|Both you and the creature find yourselves alone at a party, overwhelmed by an immense sense of loneliness despite the crowd. You both spot a person sitting alone in the corner, and you try to muster up the courage to approach them. Both of you roll Charisma saving throws. The higher roll succeeds in talking to the person, making a new friend. The lower roll, however, results in a deep sense of sadness, as the creature or you feel pathetic in the attempt. This causes the creature or you to gain one level of exhaustion from the awful experience, and you both sit down, prone at the corner, until the beginning of your next turn.|
|6|Fraudulent Elections|You and the creature are in a heated election, both running for president. Since you're the only two candidates with a chance of winning, you've both hired a sniper to take out the other. Both of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, you or the creature take Xd12 piercing damage directly to the head and become unconscious until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, you or the creature manage to dodge the bullet at the last moment, taking no damage and remaining conscious.|
|7|Hospital Tragedy|Both you and the creature just lost a patient who came begging for help, but you both... just let them perish. You both roll a Charisma check to see how you handle this situation. If you have the higher roll, you manage to leave the hospital, leaving the creature in tears, causing it to fall prone and take xd12 psychic damage from the emotional weight. If you have the lower roll, the creature slaps you for your incompetence, dealing Xd4 bludgeoning damage and walking away with a disappointed look on its face.
|8|Divorce|You and the creature have been married for quite some time, but things haven’t been going right. You both decide to divorce, but suddenly, one of your children is watching. The guilt and shame of the situation become unbearable, causing both of you to take Xd6 psychic damage and become stunned until the beginning of your next turn.|
|9|Failed Exam|You are the teacher, and the creature is a student trying to pass your class. The creature must roll a Persuasion check with disadvantage. On a success, they pass your lesson and are relieved. On a failure, they are reproved and become frightened until the beginning of your next turn, overwhelmed with fear for their future.|
|10|Tsunami|The creature and you are enjoying a nice day at the beach when you both see a giant wave approaching in the distance. In a moment's notice, the wave crashes toward you, forcing both of you to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, you both take Xd12 cold damage and are knocked prone by the force of the wave. On a success, you take half as much damage and avoid being knocked prone, managing to stay on your feet despite the powerful surge.|
|11|Alcoholism|The creature finds itself in a bar, drinking its problems away. You enter with a group of friends and family, proudly showing off your happiness. The creature looks at this and realizes how deeply alcohol has affected its life, forcing it to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes xd8 psychic damage and becomes restrained until the beginning of your next turn, feeling "stuck" in the hole they've dug for themselves. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and is not restrained, choosing to change their life and break free from their past habits.|
|12|Rejection|The creature is in high school, having a crush on you. They gather enough courage to confess their feelings, nervously admitting they have a crush on you. You refuse, saying you're not interested, causing the creature to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes xd12 psychic damage and becomes paralyzed until the beginning of your next turn, overwhelmed by the shock and heartbreak. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and is not paralyzed, handling the rejection more healthily and moving forward with resilience.|
|13|Death of a Loved One|The creature finds itself at a funeral, unsure of who has passed away. They approach the casket to get a closer look and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature mistakenly believes that the deceased person is someone very important to them, causing them to be devastated. They take Xd12 psychic damage and become stunned until the beginning of your next turn from the emotional shock. On a success, they take half as much damage and are not stunned, as they do not recognize the person who has passed and can maintain their composure.|
|14|Getting Fired|The creature is at their office job, hurriedly trying to finish their work when you, their boss, approach and say, "You're fired." Upon hearing this, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes fearful for their future, taking Xd6 psychic damage and becoming paralyzed until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, the creature realizes they dislike the job and decides to leave, taking half damage and avoiding paralysis, gaining a sense of freedom instead.|
|15|Doctor’s Office|The creature is in a doctor’s office, and you, their doctor, reveal that they have a horrible, lifelong condition. The creature must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature cannot handle the news and passes out, taking Xd12 psychic damage and becoming unconscious until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, they manage to process the devastating news, taking half as much damage and avoiding unconsciousness, staying conscious and resilient.|
|16|Wanted Poster|The creature is walking down the street when they suddenly see a police officer — you. You are holding a wanted poster, and the creature notices that the person on the poster looks a lot like them. The creature then insists that they are not the person on the poster. The creature must make a Persuasion check with disadvantage, while you must make an Insight check. If your Insight check is higher, you arrest them, and they become restrained until the beginning of your next turn. If the creature's Persuasion check is higher, they successfully convince you and avoid being arrested, remaining unrestrained.|
|17|Adoption|You and the creature are both orphans in an orphanage. A couple comes in, looking to adopt, but they can only take one child. Both you and the creature must make Performance checks. The one with the higher roll is adopted. If the creature doesn't roll higher, they are extremely disappointed, gaining a level of exhaustion. If the creature rolls higher, they are adopted and are not disappointed, avoiding exhaustion entirely.|
|18|Engine Failure|The creature is driving down the road when their car suddenly breaks down. They pull over and attempt to fix the car. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you drive by and insult them, causing them to take Xd12 psychic damage and become stunned until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, the creature fixes the car before you drive by, taking half the damage and avoiding being stunned.|
|19|Rude Customer|The creature is a server at a restaurant, and they are serving you. After paying the bill, you leave before the creature has a chance to see it. The creature picks up the check and sees that you left no tip. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes Xd12 psychic damage and is knocked prone from the disappointment. On a success, they take half the damage and remain standing, not prone.|
|20|School Bully|The creature and you are both in class, and you and your friends begin to insult the creature. However, the creature has a comeback. Both of you must make a Performance check. If your roll is higher, the creature’s comeback falls flat, and you and your friends bully them even more. The creature takes Xd12 psychic damage and becomes frightened until the beginning of your next turn. If the creature rolls higher, your friends laugh at you alongside the creature. This causes you much shame, and you fall to the floor, crying. You become incapacitated, prone, and your speed becomes 0 for 1 minute. During this time, you cannot be targeted by attacks or hit by saving throws.|

To keep Tragedy active, you must spend 2 Cursed Energy at the beginning of each of your turns, as the emotional toll is draining on your soul. Additionally, a Tragedy shares the same cooldown as Comedian, meaning that when Comedian is on cooldown, Tragedy is also on cooldown, and vice versa.

Tragedy ends if you become charmed, fall unconscious, or if you no longer have any Cursed Energy to spend. You can also end it at will.
