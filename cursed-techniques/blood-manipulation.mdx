As a user of the Blood Manipulation, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Blood Crystallization
You can freely change the shape and density of your blood, using it for both offense and defense. When you activate your Cursed Energy Armor, you gain resistance to piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage. You can also choose to spend Blood Points instead of Cursed Energy to activate it, spending 2 Blood Points per 1 Cursed Energy. When you deal damage with the Cursed Strikes, Cursed Weapon Enhancement, or Curse-Empowered Strikes features, you may change the damage type to piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage, depending on your choice. Additionally, while your Cursed Energy Armor is active, your unarmed strike damage dice tier is increased by 1.

Whenever this technique hits a creature of a different race from you, they must make a Constitution saving throw against your Cursed Energy DC. On a failure, they are poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, they are not poisoned. A creature that fails the saving throw may attempt to remake the saving throw at the beginning of each of their turns. This poisoned condition bypasses immunities. However, a creature with the Reinforced Immune System feat is not affected by this feature.

## Level 1: Blood Points
Blood Points are a currency used to power this Innate Technique's abilities, alongside Cursed Energy. You can expend your own hit points to gain Blood Points, with 1 Blood Point gained per hit point lost. However, most users of this technique prefer to store blood in advance for battle. You can store blood in any proper vial, flask, blood bag, or other container, and start with 2 bags, each containing a pint of blood, which translates to 6 Blood Points per bag. You can also use your blood within 3 meters of you to power your abilities, with the DM determining the appropriate amount of Blood Points you can gain. If you have the Cursed Projectiles feat, you can use Blood Points instead of Cursed Energy to power it, spending 2 Blood Points per 1 Cursed Energy. You may only use your own blood for Blood Points.

If you have the *Energy to Blood* feat, Blood Points are also affected by Tokyo School's Cursed Energy economy feature.

<Note>
	Despite there being no lapse technique for blood manipulation, due to its versatility, whenever a feature requires it, anything that involves manipulating your own blood will count as a Lapse.

***Water Dilution.*** Your mastery over blood manipulation is significantly hindered when submerged in large volumes of water. While you are at least half submerged, you cannot use any of your Technique features that manipulate blood externally. The sheer volume of water disrupts the integrity of blood, preventing it from holding its shape and making external manipulation impossible. While submerged or in heavy rain, you cannot use the Blood Manipulation, Convergence, and Expanded Blood Manipulation features for the duration of your submersion or exposure to the rain. If you attempt to do so, you still spend Cursed Energy and Blood Points as normal, but nothing happens.
