As a user of the Blood Manipulation, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

<Note>
	Despite there being no lapse technique for blood manipulation, due to its versatility, whenever a feature requires it, anything that involves manipulating your own blood will count as a Lapse.
</Note>

## Level 1: Blood Crystallization
You can freely change the shape and density of your blood, using it for both offense and defense. When you activate your Cursed Energy Armor, you gain resistance to piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage. You can also choose to spend Blood Points instead of Cursed Energy to activate it, spending 2 Blood Points per 1 Cursed Energy. When you deal damage with the Cursed Strikes, Cursed Weapon Enhancement, or Curse-Empowered Strikes features, you may change the damage type to piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage, depending on your choice. Additionally, while your Cursed Energy Armor is active, your unarmed strike damage dice tier is increased by 1.

Whenever this technique hits a creature of a different race from you, they must make a Constitution saving throw against your Cursed Energy DC. On a failure, they are poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, they are not poisoned. A creature that fails the saving throw may attempt to remake the saving throw at the beginning of each of their turns. This poisoned condition bypasses immunities. However, a creature with the Reinforced Immune System feat is not affected by this feature.

## Level 1: Blood Points
Blood Points are a currency used to power this Innate Technique's abilities, alongside Cursed Energy. You can expend your own hit points to gain Blood Points, with 1 Blood Point gained per hit point lost. However, most users of this technique prefer to store blood in advance for battle. You can store blood in any proper vial, flask, blood bag, or other container, and start with 2 bags, each containing a pint of blood, which translates to 6 Blood Points per bag. You can also use your blood within 3 meters of you to power your abilities, with the DM determining the appropriate amount of Blood Points you can gain. If you have the Cursed Projectiles feat, you can use Blood Points instead of Cursed Energy to power it, spending 2 Blood Points per 1 Cursed Energy. You may only use your own blood for Blood Points.

If you have the *Energy to Blood* feat, Blood Points are also affected by Tokyo School's Cursed Energy economy feature.

***Water Dilution.*** Your mastery over blood manipulation is significantly hindered when submerged in large volumes of water. While you are at least half submerged, you cannot use any of your Technique features that manipulate blood externally. The sheer volume of water disrupts the integrity of blood, preventing it from holding its shape and making external manipulation impossible. While submerged or in heavy rain, you cannot use the Blood Manipulation, Convergence, and Expanded Blood Manipulation features for the duration of your submersion or exposure to the rain. If you attempt to do so, you still spend Cursed Energy and Blood Points as normal, but nothing happens.

## Level 1: Blood Manipulation (Extension Technique)
You have begun to grasp the essence of your innate technique, granting you the ability to manipulate blood at will. This allows you to use the following cursed techniques:

- ***Crimson Binding.*** You pull blood from the surrounding area to create a net that envelops an opponent. As an action, by expending 1 Cursed Energy and 4 Blood Points, you target a creature within 10 meters. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Cursed Energy DC or become restrained. A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength saving throw, freeing itself on a success.

- ***Slicing Exorcism.*** You create a rapidly spinning wheel of blood, using it as a bladed projectile. As an action, by expending 5 Cursed Energy and 6 Blood Points, you form a small, 1-meter-wide blood wheel that lasts for 1 minute. As a bonus action, you can move the wheel up to 10 meters to a location you can see. When the wheel moves through a creature’s space, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 2d8 slashing damage, or half as much on a success. You may force a creature to make this saving throw once per round. This technique’s damage increases to 5d8 at 11th level, 9d8 at 17th level, and 14d8 at 20th level.

- ***Blood Weight.*** As a free action, by expending 3 Cursed Energy, you can weigh down a creature covered in your blood, whether on their body or staining their clothes. For each Blood Point worth of blood on the creature, their speed is reduced by 1 meter. If this reduction brings their speed to half its normal value, they have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws. If their speed is reduced to 0, they automatically fail Dexterity saving throws. You must spend 1 Cursed Energy at the start of the weighed-down creature’s turn to maintain this effect.

- ***Blood Spit.*** A dirty tactic, but you'll do whatever it takes to win—even spitting blood in your enemy’s eyes to blind them. As a bonus action, or once per round when taking damage, you may spend 3 Blood Points to make a melee Cursed Energy attack roll against a creature within 1 meter. On a hit, their face is covered in your blood for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. For 3 Cursed Energy, either when covering a creature’s face in blood or at any time while their face remains covered, you may cause the blood to burst. This deals 4d4 piercing damage to them and two eye limbs on their face, and blinds them until the end of their next turn. If they were performing an action when you burst the blood, they must make a concentration saving throw or fail to complete the action (without wasting the resources used to attempt it). You cannot use this while incapacitated. Once you activate this feature, the blood covering their face dissipates early.

- ***Reattachment.*** If you take damage that severs a limb, you may reattach it as part of healing yourself using Reverse Cursed Technique or Regeneration, provided the limb is not destroyed (as determined by the DM). By spending 3 Cursed Energy and 6 Blood Points, you can grab the severed limb and pull it back into place, significantly reducing the healing required. The limb is restored to the number of hit points it had before it was severed, and you regain that many hit points.

- ***Blood Tidal Wave.*** As an action, by spending 10 Cursed Energy and an amount of Blood Points up to your level × your Charisma modifier, you unleash a tidal wave of blood from your body. All creatures that enter the area or start their turn within it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take Xd8 bludgeoning damage and fall prone; on a success, they take half damage and do not fall prone. X equals 1/5 of the Blood Points spent (rounded down). The wave extends outward in a radius equal to the number of Blood Points spent, up to a maximum of 10 meters. If you spend enough Blood Points that the radius would exceed 10 meters, the wave expands an additional 10 meters at the start of each of your turns until it reaches its full intended size, at which point it remains centered where it was first created until the effect ends.

You can determine how many Blood Points a creature has on them based on the cost of the technique that hit them before any reductions. For example, if a creature is hit by a technique that costs 10 Blood Points, they now have 10 Blood Points on them. If the technique involved a saving throw and the creature succeeded, taking only partial effects and damage, they only gain half the Blood Points. If they completely avoid the effects and damage—such as through the Evasion feature—no Blood Points are transferred.

A creature exposed to light rain loses 5 Blood Points at the end of its turn, as well as when splashed by a small amount of water (e.g., a bucket of water or laying in shallow water). A creature exposed to heavy rain loses 10 Blood Points at the end of its turn, as well as when hit by a large source of water (e.g., an engulfing wave or a powerful water-based technique/spell). A creature that is half or fully submerged cannot have Blood Points on it.

## Level 3: Flowing Red Scale (Extension Technique)
This technique elevates the user's body temperature, pulse rate, and red blood cell count, granting them significantly enhanced energy and physical capabilities. As a free action, you may spend 3 Cursed Energy to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Your speed is doubled.
- You gain a +2 bonus to AC.
- You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.
- You gain an additional action on each of your turns, which can only be used to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

If you activate Maximum Output, this technique transforms into Flowing Red Scale: Stack, further amplifying your physical capabilities:

- Your movement speed is doubled.
- You gain an additional +2 bonus to AC.
- Once per turn, you can reroll a failed Dexterity saving throw and must use the new result.
- You gain an additional bonus action on each of your turns.
- You gain an additional reaction per round.

***Flowing Red Scale: Focus.*** Starting at 5th level, you have learned to concentrate your Flowing Red Scale on a specific part of your body or task, amplifying its effects in that area. For example, you can focus it in your eyes to enhance dynamic visual acuity or into your circulatory system to generate heat and melt ice off your body. At any time (no action required), you may choose Perception checks or ability checks using Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, sacrificing a number of benefits from Flowing Red Scale and Flowing Red Scale: Stack until the end of your next turn. The first benefit sacrificed grants advantage on the chosen type of check. Each additional benefit sacrificed grants a +2 bonus to that check. You may also apply this effect to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throws, but for these, you gain only a +1 bonus per two benefits sacrificed after the first.

## Level 6: Convergence (Extension Technique)
You have mastered one of the most powerful Blood Manipulation techniques: Convergence. As a bonus action, you can activate Convergence to compress and condense blood to its absolute limit for 1 minute.

While Convergence is active, whenever you use a cursed technique, you can spend additional Cursed Energy (and an equal amount of Blood Points) up to your Charisma modifier to enhance its potency. For each Cursed Energy spent, the technique gains one additional damage die or one additional turn of duration.

Additionally, while Convergence is active, you can perform the following techniques:

- ***Piercing Blood.*** You condense blood into a highly pressurized beam capable of piercing through targets and structures. As an action, for 8 Cursed Energy and 15 Blood Points, you fire a concentrated stream of blood at a target within 20 meters. Make a ranged cursed energy attack roll with advantage. On a hit, the target takes 7d12 piercing damage. If you have spent the maximum amount on Convergence before using this technique, you may instead fire a 1-meter-wide, 40-meter-long beam. All creatures in its path must make a Dexterity saving throw (with disadvantage on the initial use). On a failure, they take full damage; on a success, they take half. While in line form, you may create a new beam each round by spending half the initial Cursed Energy and Blood Points as an action. This form requires concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. The damage increases to 10d12 at 11th level, 14d12 at 17th level, and 19d12 at 20th level.

- ***Blood Rain.*** You fire a pressurized beam of blood into the sky, causing it to rain down in hundreds of razor-sharp droplets. As an action, for 4 Cursed Energy and 8 Blood Points, you launch a beam of blood directly upward. You can choose for it to fall at the end of your turn or delay it for up to your Charisma modifier rounds. When the Blood Rain falls, all creatures within a 10-meter-radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 6d8 piercing damage; on a success, they take half. The damage increases to 8d8 at 11th level, 11d8 at 17th level, and 15d8 at 20th level.

- ***Blood Terrain Infusion.*** By spreading your blood into the ground, you can manipulate and reshape the terrain. As an action, for 8 Cursed Energy and 12 Blood Points, you spread blood in a 10-meter-radius circle centered anywhere within range, as long as you are inside it. All creatures in the affected area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 5d10 piercing damage and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half damage and remain standing. If you have spent the maximum amount on Convergence, you may raise a 30-meter-tall cylindrical pillar from the area, lifting all creatures inside to its top. Creatures that succeeded on their saving throw (including yourself) may choose to escape before being elevated. Additionally, if you have used Piercing Blood or Blood Rain on the ground within the past minute, you may cast this ability from that location, as your blood remains infused in the terrain.

- ***Blood Wave.*** You generate a massive wave of blood that expands outward before dissipating. As an action, for 6 Cursed Energy and 10 Blood Points, you release a circular wave of blood expanding up to 10 meters around you. All creatures in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and are pushed to the edge of the wave's range. On a success, they take half damage and remain in place, breaking through the blood. If you spend additional Cursed Energy using Convergence, the maximum range increases by 3 meters per Cursed Energy spent.  The damage increases to 8d6 at 11th level, 11d6 at 17th level, and 15d6 at 20th level.

## Level 10: Blood Manipulation Expansion (Extension Technique)
You have mastered the ability to expand and enhance your control over blood while Convergence is active, granting you access to new techniques. These techniques can only be used while Convergence is active.

- ***Blood Spikes.*** You manifest sharp spikes of blood that rapidly fire at enemies. As an action, for 8 Cursed Energy and 12 Blood Points, you can summon up to 10 blood spikes and hurl them at targets within 20 meters. Each spike requires a ranged cursed energy attack roll and replaces an attack in the Attack action. On a hit, each spike deals 4d10 piercing damage. If you have spent the maximum amount for Convergence before using this technique, the number of spikes increases to 15, and their damage increases to 5d10. At 17th level, the damage increases to 6d10, and when spending the maximum amount for Convergence, it increases to 8d10. At 20th level, the damage increases to 8d10, and when spending the maximum amount for Convergence, it increases to 10d10.

- ***Blood Caltrops.*** You summon caltrops made of crystallized blood that hover and strike enemies that enter your space. As an action, for 7 Cursed Energy and 10 Blood Points, you create 10 blood caltrops that hover in a 10-meter radius around you for 1 minute. Whenever an enemy enters this area or begins its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d8 piercing damage and its movement speed is reduced by 10 meters. On a success, it takes half damage and its movement is not reduced. If you have spent the maximum amount for Convergence, the number of caltrops increases to 15, their damage increases to 4d8, and the movement reduction increases to 20 meters. At 17th level, the damage increases to 6d8 and the movement reduction increases to 12 meters. If you have spent the maximum amount for Convergence, the movement reduction increases to 24 meters. At 20th level, the damage increases to 8d8 and the movement reduction increases to 20 meters. If you have spent the maximum amount for Convergence, the movement reduction increases to 40 meters.

- ***Blood Shield.*** You create a protective barrier of blood around yourself, absorbing incoming damage. As a reaction, for 6 Cursed Energy and 10 Blood Points, you form a blood shield with hit points equal to the total amount of Cursed Energy and Blood Points spent, multiplied by your proficiency bonus. This shield absorbs damage before any other effects apply. When the shield’s hit points are reduced to zero, any remaining damage is halved, and you take the remaining damage. If you have spent the maximum amount for Convergence, the shield can now protect other creatures. When activated, it covers a 3-meter radius centered on you, shielding others from damage. Any remaining damage is still halved but is only dealt to you. At 17th level, the remaining damage is instead reduced to a quarter, and at 20th level, the shield’s hit points are doubled.

- ***Blood Meteorite.*** You have learned how to harden your blood and launch it at an opponent. As an action, for 6 Cursed Energy and 8 Blood Points, you target a creature within 10 meters. Make a ranged cursed energy attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 6d12 bludgeoning damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is stunned until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, it is not stunned. This technique’s damage increases to 10d12 at 17th level and 15d12 at 20th level. This technique can be used without Convergence being active and is not affected by Water Dilution.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Wing King Imitation (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned to push your imagination to new limits. As a bonus action, for 10 Cursed Energy and 10 Blood Points, you can activate an imitation of your counterpart’s Rot Technique, granting you the following benefits for 1 minute:

- You can replace attacks in the Attack action with any one of your offensive Blood Manipulation features, except for attacks from the Cursed Blast of Blows feature.
- The range of your Technique features increases by 5 meters.
- You can use Homing Blood.

***Homing Blood.*** As an action, for 8 Cursed Energy and 15 Blood Points, you create a homing beam of blood. Make a ranged cursed energy attack roll against a creature within 40 meters. On a hit, the target takes 7d8 piercing damage. If the attack misses, you may choose to re-roll it a number of times per turn equal to half your Charisma modifier (rounded down). The beam’s damage increases to 10d8 at 17th level and 14d8 at 20th level.

Additionally, if you have the Supernova feat, you may create one orb (as per the feat) as part of firing the beam, using the beam as a conduit to deliver compressed blood. On a miss that you do not re-roll, you may place the orb in an unoccupied space within 1 meter of the missed target and choose when to detonate it, following the feat’s rules. On a hit, the orb is placed in the hit target’s space. If the orb is detonated before the end of your turn, saving throws against it are made at disadvantage. You may also choose to intentionally miss with the beam, even if the attack would otherwise hit.

## Level 20: Crimson Overflow (Technique Improvement)
You have mastered the ability to condense, accelerate, and launch your blood with maximum speed, efficiency, and lethality. Every feature of this cursed technique now costs half as many Blood Points (rounded down). 

Additionally, every time you spend extra Cursed Energy on your features while Convergence is active, each point of Cursed Energy spent counts as 4, though it still cannot exceed your maximum. This applies to damage, duration, and temporary hit points in the case of your Cursed Energy Armor. Finally, you gain an additional reaction per round.

## Technique Reversal: Puppet Creation
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

With your mastery over both Reverse Cursed Technique and Blood Manipulation, you have unlocked your Technique Reversal. As an action, for 5 Cursed Energy, you can attempt to manipulate the blood within a creature’s body, turning them into your puppet. The target must be within 20 meters and must have been affected by a slashing or piercing attack within the last round, be under the Bleeding condition, or otherwise have an open wound.

The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If they are dead, they automatically fail. If a Blood Manipulation user attempts to control another Blood Manipulation user, the target has advantage on the saving throw. On a success, they resist the Puppet Creation. On a failure, they become your puppet. Creatures with no bodily fluids are immune to this feature. This technique requires concentration to maintain.

The controlled target retains their ability to talk, see, hear, and think independently but loses all control over their body. A puppet cannot use their cursed technique. You can use an action or bonus action to move the target up to 10 meters or force them to attack with any weapon they have or can reach. You roll for both the attack and damage rolls, and you are considered proficient with any weapon used in this way. At the beginning of each of their turns, the creature may attempt the Constitution saving throw again to break free.
