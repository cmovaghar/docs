As a user of the Sugar Manipulation, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Creation of Sweets (Lapse Technique)
You can increase the sugar levels in your body and release it in a physical form. 

As a bonus action, you can spend 2 cursed energy to create a dessert of your choice. This dessert can be eaten by a number of people equal to your proficiency bonus. As another bonus action, someone can eat your dessert. When they do, they gain temporary cursed energy equal to the amount you spent to create the dessert. A person can only benefit from eating one dessert at a time. The amount of cursed energy you can spend on this feature increases as you level up: to 4 cursed energy at 5th level, to 6 cursed energy at 11th level, to 8 cursed energy at 17th level, and to 10 cursed energy at 20th level.

However, there are risks to using too much sugar. If you spend more cursed energy than your Constitution score on your innate technique within a minute, you will experience low blood sugar. While you have low blood sugar, your movement speed is reduced by 1 meter, and you gain a level of exhaustion. If you wish to spend more cursed energy on your technique after your blood sugar has been lowered, you must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a success, you can continue using your technique as normal. On a failure, your movement speed is reduced by another 1 meter, and you gain another level of exhaustion. After 1 minute, your sugar levels return to normal, and you regain your normal movement speed while losing the levels of exhaustion.

## Level 3: Sugar Control (Extension Technique)
You can increase the sugar levels in your body and the bodies of others. As an action, you can spend 5 cursed energy to elevate the sugar levels of yourself or another creature. While their sugar levels are elevated, they gain the following benefits:

- Their speed increases by 3 meters.
- They gain an extra action each turn, which can be used to Dodge, Dash, Disengage, or make one additional melee or weapon attack.
- When using a cursed energy-fueled feature, its cost is reduced by half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down).

These effects last for 1 minute. Once the effect ends, the creature gains a level of exhaustion.

## Level 6: Pudding Pad (Technique Improvement)
You have learned to create a much larger dessert. 

As a reaction, you can spend 10 cursed energy to conjure a 5-by-5-meter dessert within 10 meters of you. This can be used in response to a line or cone effect that requires a Dexterity saving throw, a ranged attack roll, or to cushion someone from falling. The dessert has 100 hit points and can absorb damage or reduce fall damage accordingly.

## Level 10: Sugar Rush (Technique Improvement)
You have enhanced your ability to increase sugar levels in the body, granting even greater benefits. 

As an action, you can spend 10 cursed energy to further elevate the sugar levels of yourself or another creature. While under this effect, they gain the following benefits:

- Their speed doubles.
- They gain an extra action each turn, which can be used to Dodge, Dash, Disengage, or make one additional melee or weapon attack.
- When using a cursed energy-fueled feature, its cost is reduced by half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down), to a minimum of 1.
- They gain a +2 bonus to AC.
- They have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.

These effects last for 1 minute. Once the effect ends, the creature gains 2 levels of exhaustion.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Sweetful Addiction (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Your studies at the Tokyo school have taught you a new way to manipulate sugar levels. 

You can now apply one benefit from your Sugar Control feature over an extended period. By spending 15 cursed energy during a short or long rest, you can grant a creature one benefit from your Sugar Control. This effect lasts until the creature takes a long rest. You can maintain these long-term benefits for a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus, including yourself.

## Level 20: Sugar God (Technique Improvement)
You have unlocked a deeper understanding of sugar manipulation, allowing you to push the body to its limits. 

As an action, you can spend 15 cursed energy to elevate the sugar levels of yourself or another creature, granting the following benefits:

- Their speed doubles.
- They gain an extra action each turn, which can be used to Dodge, Dash, Disengage, or make one additional melee or weapon attack.
- When using a cursed energy-fueled feature, its cost is reduced by your Charisma modifier.
- They gain a +2 bonus to AC.
- They have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.
- They have advantage on Perception checks.
- They gain an additional reaction each turn.
- Their melee unarmed and weapon attacks deal extra damage equal to Xd6, where X is your Charisma modifier. The extra damage type matches that of the attack.

These effects last for 1 minute. Once the effect ends, the creature gains 3 levels of exhaustion.

## Technique Reversal: Sugar Drainage
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Having mastered Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked your Cursed Technique Reversal, allowing you to drain sugar from others. 

As an action, you can spend 10 cursed energy to touch a creature and force them to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they suffer the following effects:

- They gain one level of exhaustion.
- Their speed is reduced by 3 meters.
- The cost of their cursed energy-fueled features increases by half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down).

On a successful save, they are unaffected.
