As a user of the Contractual Re-Creation, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Contractual Re-Creation (Lapse Technique)
You have learned the basics of your technique in materializing things from receipts. 

You begin with 5 receipts of your choice. To materialize something from a receipt, you must use an action and spend the required amount of cursed energy for the effect. Once the materialization is complete, the receipt is burned and turns to ashes. You cannot use this technique if the receipts are wet. You can summon your materializations anywhere within your sight range.

There are four types of receipt effects you can receive, depending on what the receipt pertains to:

|Materialization Size|Cursed Energy Cost|
|:-|:-:|
|Tiny|2|
|Small|4|
|Medium|6|
|Large|8|
|Huge|10|
|Gargantuan|20|

***Object.*** You can summon an object from the receipt, spending cursed energy equal to its size.

***Vehicle.*** You can summon a vehicle from the receipt, spending cursed energy equal to its size.

***Reservation.*** You can use a reservation receipt for 4 cursed energy, granting you the same benefits as staying at the specified location for its full duration. For example, a 2-day spa reservation would provide the benefits of a long rest.

***Structure.*** You can create a structure from a receipt for 20 cursed energy.

All things created through your technique last indefinitely.

## Level 3: Quicker Summons (Technique Improvement)
You have become more proficient in utilizing your technique, gaining a faster activation method. 

You can now materialize receipts as either an action or a bonus action.

At 20th level, you can materialize receipts as an action, bonus action, or even a free action.

## Level 6: Multi Summon (Technique Improvement)
You have become even more skilled with your technique, now able to use multiple receipts at a time. 

You can now use a number of receipts equal to your proficiency bonus simultaneously, as long as you're holding them all.

## Level 10: Telepathic Control (Extension Technique)
You have learned how to manipulate your materializations using your mind. You can manipulate objects or vehicles as a bonus action by spending 4 cursed energy per object or vehicle manipulated, with each type functioning differently.

***Objects.*** You can telepathically manipulate a number of objects you have summoned. You may move them in the air up to your sight range and use them normally from afar. After they are used, they disappear.

***Weapon.*** Once per turn, you may make a melee cursed energy attack roll with a weapon you have summoned during one of your attacks on your attack action. On a hit, it deals 5 dice of the weapon's damage type. This increases to 7 dice at 11th level, to 10 dice at 17th level, and to 14 dice at 20th level.

***Vehicles.*** You can order a vehicle to move up to a certain distance, after which it vanishes.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Surprise Materialization (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have created an extension for your technique, a triumph of sorts. 

As a reaction to any hostile action taken against you, you can materialize one of your receipts for twice the cursed energy cost in a surprise attack. You force the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage. On a failure, they take 4d12 bludgeoning damage per size of the object, with an additional 4d12 added for each size above Tiny. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage.

The objects vanish immediately after hitting the creature.

## Level 20: Master of Receipts (Technique Improvement)
You have become a master at utilizing your receipts. The cost of materializing things is now halved, and objects you control through telepathic manipulation can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.

## Technique Reversal: Contractual Transformation
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have learned how to reverse your technique, transforming objects into receipts. 

As a bonus action, for an amount of cursed energy determined by the object's size, you can transform it into a receipt, as long as it could realistically be sold. You cannot use this ability on magical objects, cursed objects, cursed tools, or if a creature is holding the object.

The cost of transforming an object is defined below:
|Materialization Size|Cursed Energy Cost|
|:-|:-:|
|Tiny|4|
|Small|8|
|Medium|12|
|Large|16|
|Huge|20|
|Gargantuan|40|

This reversal is affected by your Master of Receipts feature.
