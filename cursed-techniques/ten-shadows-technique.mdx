As a user of the Ten Shadows Technique, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Shikigami Summoning (Lapse Technique)
You gain the prized technique of the Zenin clan: the Ten Shadows. This technique allows you to summon shikigami from the shadows, with two methods: *Summoning* and *Trial*. You start with the *Divine Dogs* shikigami and can summon two of them (they count as one summoned shikigami).

### Trial
As an action, you may summon an untamed shikigami you’ve not yet defeated in a trial. The shikigami appears 1 meter from you, is under the DM’s control, is hostile toward you, and acts on its own turn. If you reduce the untamed shikigami to 0 hit points in combat, without any help (you may use your tamed shikigami), it becomes tamed and is now under your control.

Creatures within 5 meters of you or the untamed shikigami are considered part of the trial. If you are reduced to 0 hit points while any creature other than the untamed shikigami is part of the trial, you are stabilized. You will resume death saving throws only if the untamed shikigami or all other creatures are slain. Additionally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, the untamed shikigami becomes hostile to all other creatures within the trial.

### Summoning
As an action, you can spend Cursed Energy as shown in the Shikigami table to summon a shikigami you’ve already tamed through a trial. The shikigami appears on a space within 10 meters of you. It lasts until reduced to 0 hit points, dismissed (no action required out of combat, during your turn, or as a reaction when it’s about to take damage), or until you take a short or long rest. It retains its current health when dismissed and regains all lost hit points at the end of a long rest. You can summon any number of shikigami, but can only control a number equal to your Charisma modifier. You can control your summoned shikigami in three ways:
- **Simple Command**. As a bonus action, you control the shikigami's actions for the turn.
- **Complex Command**. As an action, you issue a task (e.g., protect a creature, guard an area). The shikigami will continue trying to complete the task until it finishes, is dismissed, or becomes unable to continue (such as if it dies or can't locate its target).
- **Reaction Command**. Your shikigami can take reactions independently, with no action required from you.

Whenever an attack reduces your actual hit points, you must make a concentration check for each of your summoned shikigami. If you fail the check, you can spend 1 cursed energy to succeed instead.

When one of your tamed shikigami dies in combat, they can no longer be summoned ever again. Should this happen, they are now eligible for Totality.

### Totality
You may perform a 1-hour ritual during a short or long rest to merge one of your slain summon with another one still alive. The live summons enter it's Totality state, inheriting the strengths of the deceased shikigami and gains the following changes.
- Their Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma scores are set to the higher score between the two creatures. After that, add the modifier of the lower score to the higher one.
- They gain a number of hit dice equal to the total from both creatures, using the hit die size each creature normally has.
- Their movement speeds are added together.
- The combined creature gains all features, traits, actions, bonus actions, reactions, legendary actions, skill and saving throw proficiencies, damage resistances, damage immunities, and condition immunities from both creatures.
- The combined creature’s size will match the size of the larger creature.
- The combined creature’s Challenge Rating (CR) is set to the higher CR of the two. Then, add half of the CR of the lower creature, rounding up.

Once a deceased shikigami has been merged, it cannot be merged again.

### Summoning Techniques
When you defeat an untamed shikigami through trial, you gain a special way of summoning it.

You start with one of those special ways and can gain more through Ten Shadows feats.

***Rabbit Escape.*** You can spend 3 Cursed Energy to summon *Rabbit Escape* as a reaction when you are hit by an attack. If you do so, add your Charisma modifier to your AC, including against the triggering attack. If the triggering attack misses, you reappear in any place within your movement speed range without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Stronger Shadows
Your shikigami grow alongside you as you become stronger. Your tamed shikigami gain a bonus equal to 1/10th of your maximum Cursed Energy to the following stats : Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma, Number of hit dice, Attack roll damage die, Healing features die, Saving throws DC.

These bonuses are not applied when performing *Totality* or *The Well's Unknown Abyss*, only after.

## Level 3: Shadow Manipulation (Lapse Technique)
You have learned to harness your ability to manipulate shadows, enabling you to create an extra-dimensional space to store your belongings and subtly manipulate the shadows of other creatures. You gain the following features.

### Shadow Storage
You can store objects in an extra-dimensional space within your shadow. You may physically place an item into your shadow without spending any cursed energy; however, you must spend 1 cursed energy to interact with an object in this space, including removing it. All items stored in your shadow still count against your carrying capacity. It can also hold your summoned shikigamis, which count as objects for the purpose of this feature.

Additionally, you can trap hostile creatures within your shadow storage. As a bonus action, for 2 Cursed Energy, you may force a creature standing on darkness to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your Cursed Energy DC. The creature makes this saving throw with disadvantage if it is completely covered in darkness or inside a veil. If the creature is within your domain, it automatically fails this check unless it has the ability to stand or run on liquids. On a successful check, the creature avoids falling into your shadow storage. On a failed check, the creature is trapped inside your shadow storage.

The creature’s weight counts against your carrying capacity. It can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) before beginning to suffocate. The creature can attempt a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and appears in an unoccupied space within 1 meter of you.

### Shadow Ridge
When a creature within 5 meters of you makes an attack roll, you can use a reaction and spend 4 Cursed Energy to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage against your Cursed Energy DC. On a failed save, the target must roll the attack with disadvantage as their legs momentarily fall into their own shadow. You can only impose disadvantage on this saving throw once per round.

## Level 6: The Well's Unknown Abyss (Extension Technique)
You can combine two of your shikigami into a single fused form, sacrificing their individual strengths to create a versatile but slightly weaker entity. As an action, you can spend 6 cursed energy to fuse a base shikigami with an enhancer shikigami. The fusion ends if the fused shikigami drops to 0 hit points or if you dismiss it as a bonus action. When it ends, both shikigami return to the state they were before the fusion. You cannot fuse *Rabbit Escape* or *Mahoraga*. While fused, the shikigami follows these rules:
- Designate one shikigami as the base and another as the enhancer, therefore refered to as the "Base" and "Enhancer".
- The fused shikigami inherits all traits of both shikigami and gains a *Shikigami Alteration* feature depending on the enhancer, as described in the table below. 
- The fused shikigami gains no immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities from either shikigami.
- The fused shikigami's hit points, speed, and ability scores are reduced to half what they were (rounded down).
- The fused shikigami gains one condition immunity of your choice from the base or the enhancer.
- The fused shikigami's CR equals the base's CR plus half the enhancer's CR.
- The fused shikigami's AC and size matches the base.
- The fused shikigami's size can be reduced, and its quantity increased. For every size reduction, the number of shikigami summoned doubles. This reduction can happen a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). Aditionnally, whenever the size reduction happens, the CR, Strength score and Constitution score are split evenly among the summoned shikigami.

| Shikigami | Shikigami Alteration |
|:-|:-|
| Divine Dogs | Pack Tactics feature. |
| Gama |  Support Carry, Tongue, Swallow, and Tongue Grab features. |
| Great Serpent | Shadow Burrow feature, 10 m. burrow speed and 10 m. swim speed. |
| Nue | Gives 30 m. fly speed. |
| Round Deer | Reverse Cursed Technique feature. |
| Piercing Ox | Battering Ram feature and the Gore attack. |
| Mourn Tiger | Sprint feature. |
| Max Elephant | Hit dice increased by 20. |

## Level 10: Shadow Manipulation Improvement (Technique Improvement)
You have honed your mastery over shadows, allowing you to manipulate the shadows of others and employ shadows in unique and esoteric ways. Your shadow manipulation features are enhanced.

### Shadow Merge
You gain greater mastery over shadow manipulation, allowing you to connect to the shadows of others and summon your creatures from their shadows.

As a free action during a short or long rest, you can connect to the shadow of a creature within 40 meters of you. You can maintain a connection to a number of creatures’ shadows equal to your proficiency bonus. If you attempt to connect to a new shadow after reaching this limit, the oldest connection is replaced.

As a bonus action, you can spend 4 cursed energy to teleport behind the shadow of a creature you’re connected to, as long as they are within 40 meters. If you have any of your shikigami summoned, you can spend an additional 4 cursed energy to teleport one of them alongside you.

As a bonus action, you can spend 4 cursed energy to sink into your own shadow or the shadow of a creature you’re connected to. While inside the shadow, you are considered invisible and have total cover. However, taking any action causes you to leave the shadow, appearing within 1 meter of the creature. You are also forced out of the shadow if the creature is knocked unconscious. You can remain inside the shadow for a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

If you use this feature on a hostile creature, they must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your cursed energy DC. On a success, they become aware of your presence behind them. On a failure, they are surprised. If you were completely hidden before teleporting to their shadow, they make this check with disadvantage.

### Shadow Summon
You have learned to hinder your opponents by using their own shadows against them. When you summon your Shikigami, you can spend an additional 8 cursed energy to summon it through the shadow of a creature whose shadow you are currently inhabiting. When summoned this way, the Shikigami can immediately take one action it is capable of. If the action requires an attack roll, the roll has advantage. If it forces the target to make a saving throw, the target rolls with disadvantage. You can also now summon your Shikigami as a bonus action.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Incomplete Shadows (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Your technique has long been revered in the jujutsu world for its rarity and fame. However, you identified a significant weakness: the death of your Shikigami. To address this, you have developed a summoning technique that allows you to create unstable shadow versions of your Shikigami, sacrificing some power for a temporary, expendable form.

Whenever you summon a tamed Shikigami, you can spend additional cursed energy (up to your Charisma modifier) to summon it in an unstable form. While in this form, its maximum hit points and all damage it deals are halved (rounded down). The form lasts for a number of rounds equal to the cursed energy spent or until you choose to end it (no action required).

While in its unstable form, any hit points lost or resources expended by the Shikigami are restored when the form ends. If the Shikigami is destroyed while in its unstable form, you retain the ability to summon it again later.

When the unstable form ends, you can immediately summon the Shikigami in its normal form at the same location without expending additional cursed energy.

## Level 20: Shikigami Gigantification (Extension Technique)
You have developed a technique that allows you to enhance the size of your Shikigami.

When summoning a Shikigami created by your cursed technique, you can spend an additional 10 cursed energy or three times the normal summoning cost (whichever is higher) to increase its size up to Gargantuan. If the Shikigami is already Gargantuan, you can enhance its size further, doubling both its height and width.

When a Shikigami’s size is increased this way, it gains the following benefits:
- Its hit dice increase by two for each size increase.
- The damage dice for its attack rolls increase by one for each size increase.
- The damage dice for any saving throw effects it causes increase by two for each size increase.
- Its Constitution score increases by two for each size increase (to a maximum of 30).

You cannot use this extension technique on the *Eight-Handled Sword Divergent Sila Divine General Mahoraga* or on a Totality that include more than two Shikigami.

## Technique Reversal: Light Manipulation
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Through great mastery of Reversed Cursed Technique, you have discovered its reversal—channeling light instead of shadow, illuminating the shadow of yourself or another creature.

### Level 1: Light Manipulation
You cannot blind yourself with Light Manipulation features. Also, using any Light Manipulation feature causes your shadow storage to become unstable. One random object, if any, currently stored in your shadow will be ejected, appearing within 1 meter of the shadow where Light Manipulation was used.

***Blinding Flash.*** As a bonus action, you can spend 4 cursed energy to target a creature's shadow that you can see, causing it to erupt in a blinding flash of light. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is blinded until the end of your turn.

***Summon Dispelling.*** You can manipulate light to interfere with the summons of others. As a bonus action, you can invert the shadow of a summon within 40 meters that you are connected to, spending an amount of cursed energy equal to half the summon’s Challenge Rating (CR) or level (rounded down), whichever is lower. You then force its summoner to make a Charisma saving throw against your Cursed Technique DC. On a failure, the summon becomes incapacitated and cannot move until the end of your next turn. If the summoner fails the saving throw by 5 or more, the summon is de-summoned and cannot be summoned again for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier.

***Light Ridge.*** As a reaction to a melee attack roll, you can spend 8 cursed energy. If the attacker is within 2 meters of you, you may force them to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the attack misses, and the attacker is blinded until the end of their turn. A creature is immune to this effect if it does not rely on sight, such as with blindsight.

### Level 10: Improved Light Manipulation
You have mastered your cursed technique reversal.

***Disrupting Flash.*** As part of de-summoning one of your Ten Shadows Technique shikigami, you can spend 8 cursed energy to unleash a disruptive flash of light as they disappear. All creatures within a 2-meter radius of where the shikigami was must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are blinded until the beginning of their next turn.

***Zone of Light.*** You can now also use Light Manipulation to target an entire area of shadow, converting it into a blinding flash of light. As a bonus action, for 8 cursed energy, you can cause a shadow you are connected to (or your own shadow) to explode in a flash of light, affecting a 6-meter radius. All creatures within this radius must make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, they are unaffected. On a failure, they are blinded for one minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the beginning of its turns, ending the blindness on a success. Using Light Manipulation this way forces all items within your Shadow Storage to be ejected, appearing within 1 meter of the shadow where Light Manipulation was used.
