As a user of the Technique Extinguishment, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Holy Cursed Energy
When you use the Curse Empowered Strikes or Cursed Weapon Enhancement features, you can choose to change the damage type to radiant.

Additionally, when you use Cursed Energy Armor, you gain resistance to necrotic damage.

Furthermore, your technique directly targets cursed energy, meaning that Domain Amplification cannot negate the radiant damage, nor can Technique Extinguishment prevent the effects of this technique.

## Level 1: Technique Extinguishment (Lapse Technique)
You possess one of the most powerful techniques to ever exist, capable of completely nullifying jujutsu. 

As an action, you can expend 2 cursed energy to summon a trumpet made of light and blow into it. A beam of light then strikes a creature of your choice within 40 meters, forcing the creature to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d12 radiant damage and cannot use any cursed technique features. Any active effects from those features are also disabled for the next minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and retains its cursed technique features. 

A creature whose cursed technique is negated must spend double the cursed energy to activate any feature that requires it. This does not affect creatures without a cursed technique. 

Additionally, any creature reduced to 0 hit points while their technique is disabled dies from brain damage caused by the removal of their technique. Healing the removed technique requires the Burnout Recovery feature, even if the creature is revived. The creature may attempt a new saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns, ending the effect early on a success.

### Angel's Blessing
At 5th level, your technique elevates you, making you feel like a divine being meant to help others—a true angel. 

You sprout radiant wings and a halo that grant you a flying speed based on your current health. 
- At full health, your flying speed matches your walking speed. 
- At three-quarters health, your flying speed becomes three-quarters of your walking speed. 
- At half health, your flying speed is half of your walking speed.
- At one-quarter health, it is reduced to one-quarter of your walking speed.

While your wings and halo are active, you can pass through barriers such as curtains and magical walls or barriers created by spells of a level equal to or lower than your proficiency bonus without breaking them. Due to your divine nature, you also gain resistance to radiant damage.

### Improved Technique Extinguishment
At 11th level, your technique grows stronger, now able to burn your enemies’ very souls. 

The radiant damage dealt by Technique Extinguishment increases to 5d12. 

When creatures fail their saving throw against this technique, their cursed tools and magic items become nonfunctional for the rest of the duration. 

Additionally, if they fail the saving throw, they take radiant damage equal to your Curse-Empowered Strikes at the start of each of their turns, as their bodies are consumed by divine flames. This continues until they pass the saving throw or the minute ends.

Furthermore, you now deal double damage with Technique Extinguishment against Cursed Vessels.

## Level 3: Instrument Creation
You gain the ability to create various instruments made of radiant light. 

As a free action, you can summon an instrument of your choice for 1 cursed energy, where it lasts for 1 minute. You may only have one instrument summoned at a time. Each instrument provides unique benefits when used in conjunction with your Technique Extinguishment features:

***Trumpet.*** When you summon a trumpet, it amplifies the effects of your Technique Extinguishment. While wielding the trumpet, the range of the radiant beam increases by 10 meters when you use Technique Extinguishment.

***Drum.*** A drum enhances the power of your Technique Extinguishment. While wielding a drum, any creature that fails their saving throw against your Technique Extinguishment takes an additional 2d12 radiant damage.

***Flute.*** A flute creates an enchanting melody that distracts your enemies. If you use Technique Extinguishment while holding the flute, you may spend 5 additional cursed energy to impose disadvantage on the saving throw of one creature of your choice. The creature must make an additional Charisma saving throw before rolling for Technique Extinguishment. On a failure, the creature makes the saving throw with disadvantage; on a success, nothing happens.

These effects are active as long as you are wielding the instrument. The type of instrument you summon can be changed each time you use this feature.

## Level 6: Divine Aura (Extension Technique)
You have learned to use your technique not only as a powerful attack but also as a means to deter sinners or maintain pressure while in close combat. 

As a bonus action or as part of entering initiative, you can begin emitting radiant energy that represents divine judgment, costing 3 cursed energy. You now emit blinding light in a 10-meter radius centered on yourself, which counts as sunlight. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. You are unaffected by the following effects:

- Creatures within 1 meter must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until they are no longer within 1 meter of you.

- Creatures within 10 meters take 2d12 radiant damage, which cannot be increased by any means. Once the aura ends, you can maintain it by spending 2 cursed energy.

## Level 10: Jacob's Ladder (Extension Technique)
You have developed an extension of your technique so powerful that you can literally burn your opponents with radiant light as it falls upon them. 

As an action, for 10 cursed energy, while the trumpet is summoned, you blow into it and choose a point within 60 meters. A beam of light strikes down in a 3-meter circle centered on the point you select. Every creature in the area must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d12 radiant damage and suffers the same effects as Technique Extinguishment until the end of their next turn, with their speed reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, they take half damage and do not suffer the side effects.

At the start of your next turn after using Jacob’s Ladder, you can keep the beam going for 1 cursed energy, repeating all of the above effects and dealing an additional 1d12 radiant damage as an action. If a creature fails a saving throw against the beam once, they gain disadvantage on the Charisma saving throw against the next beam.

You can also use this technique to destroy cursed objects. As an action for 6 cursed energy, you can summon a trumpet of light and blow into it, making a beam of light target a cursed object or cursed tool. Make a ranged cursed energy attack roll against the cursed energy save DC. On a hit, the target is completely destroyed, removing any curses affecting creatures due to it or releasing creatures imprisoned inside.

At 13th level, if you use this technique with Maximum Output, the beam’s range increases to a 10-meter circle. Additionally, it ignores features like evasion that would reduce damage. At 17th level, the damage increases to 14d12, and at 20th level, the damage increases to 18d12.

## Level 14: Tokyo Feature - Judgment of the Fallen (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Your connection to divine retribution manifests in a powerful wave of judgment. As an action, for 8 Cursed Energy, you unleash a radiant wave in a 10-meter radius centered on yourself. All creatures of your choice within that area must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, they take 8d12 radiant damage and are considered Marked for Judgment for 1 minute. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and do not gain the Marked for Judgment status.

Marked for Judgment. Creatures marked by this effect cannot benefit from healing or temporary hit points for the duration. Additionally, the next time they take damage from your Technique Extinguishment feature or any of your abilities, they take an additional 3d12 radiant damage.

At the end of each marked creature's turn, they can make another Charisma saving throw to remove the mark early on a success.

## Level 20: Celestial Retribution (Technique Improvement)
You have ascended to a divine state, greatly enhancing your Technique Extinguishment. 

The damage dealt by Technique Extinguishment increases to 12d12 radiant damage, and its range expands to 50 meters. The duration of the effect is extended to 2 minutes. Creatures that fail their saving throw against Technique Extinguishment not only lose the ability to use their cursed techniques but also become vulnerable to radiant damage for the duration.

Additionally, if a creature reaches 0 hit points while affected by Technique Extinguishment, it is killed outright as the radiant beam completely erases their being.

## Technique Reversal: Technique Ignition
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

After mastering Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked your technique reversal. Instead of extinguishing a creature’s technique, you now amplify it for a certain period. As a bonus action, you can spend 4 cursed energy to choose one ally or enemy within 20 meters to ignite their cursed technique. For the next minute, the chosen creature's techniques are enhanced in the following ways:

- The damage dice of their techniques are increased by one step (for example, from d6 to d8).
- They can add your Charisma modifier to the damage of their techniques.

However, once the minute has elapsed, the creature suffers the effects of Technique Extinguishment for one minute, experiencing the following additional effects:

- They cannot regain cursed energy until the end of their next turn.
- Their maximum cursed energy is reduced by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier, doubled, until they finish a long rest.

If the target is an unwilling creature, they must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, they are affected by this reversal. On a successful save, nothing happens. They may attempt a new saving throw at the beginning of each of their turns, ending the effect early on a success.
