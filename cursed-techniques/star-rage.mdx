As a user of the Star Rage, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Black Hole
Despite your technique being an all-powerful tool, you know there is a limit to your powers. 

If you add more than 20 virtual mass increases, you create a black hole centered on yourself, forcing every creature within a 20-meter radius centered on you to make a Strength saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, the creature takes 60d12 force damage and is pulled to within 1 meter of the black hole. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, is knocked prone, but isn’t pulled toward the black hole.

This feature lasts for 1 minute.

A creature within 1 meter of the black hole at the start of its turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or take 30d10 force damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. A creature reduced to 0 hit points while within 1 meter of the black hole dies immediately.

A creature within 20 meters of the black hole (but not within 1 meter of it) at the end of its turn takes 30d8 cold damage. 

You receive double the amount of any damage dealt from this feature, and if that reduces your hit points to 0, you are killed outright, but the black hole continues.

All objects and structures within 40 meters of the black hole take 30d12 force damage, and the ground in this area becomes difficult terrain. Any objects or structures within 20 meter of the black hole are immediately destroyed.

After this feature ends, you must make a DC 30 Constitution saving throw or receive 5 levels of exhaustion.

## Level 1: Star Rage (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to increase your virtual mass. 

As a bonus action, by spending Cursed Energy equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), you can increase your virtual mass around your body by the amount of Cursed Energy spent for a number of rounds equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2).

The following benefits apply depending on the amount of mass you’ve added:

***Stronger Martial Arts.*** Your unarmed strike damage die increases by one for every two mass increases you gain (if you don’t have a damage die for unarmed strikes, you count as if you had a d4 for this feature).

***Mass Impact.*** With one mass increase, whenever you score a critical hit with an unarmed strike, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. With three mass increases, whenever you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, all creatures and objects in a 5 times the amount of mass increases cone behind the target are also affected by the attack roll. With five mass increases, if the target fails the Strength saving throw, its speed is reduced to half until the beginning of your next turn. With seven mass increases, the target’s speed is reduced to 0 on a failed save and halved on a successful one.

***Increased Damage.*** Your unarmed strike damage rolls gain a +1 bonus for every two mass increases you receive.

***Grappler.*** For every two mass increases, you count as one size larger for grapples. This effect stops when you count as Gargantuan.

You can only activate this technique again after the full duration has passed.

At 5th level, you can spend Cursed Energy up to your Charisma modifier + half your Charisma modifier (rounded down) in this technique. This limit increases to your Charisma modifier added twice at 11th level, your Charisma modifier added thrice at 17th level, and your Charisma modifier added four times at 20th level.

## Level 3: Critical Attacks (Technique Improvement)
As your technique grows stronger, so does your power with unarmed strikes. 

For every four mass increases you receive, your unarmed strike critical hit range is reduced by 1 (20 → 19 → 18), but it cannot be reduced below 18.

Additionally, whenever you score a critical hit with an unarmed strike while your technique is active, you roll one additional damage die.

## Level 6: Increased Strength (Technique Improvement)
Your mass now increases your overall strength, not just the power of your strikes. 

When you reach five mass increases, you gain advantage on Strength checks and saving throws. For every additional five mass increases, you gain a +1 bonus to these checks and saving throws.

Additionally, while benefiting from Star Rage, you now deal twice as much damage to objects and structures.

## Level 10: Quick Activation (Technique Improvement)
You have learned how to activate your technique more quickly. 

You can now activate Star Rage as a free action.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Shared Mass (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

While you are primarily a solo fighter, you learned at Tokyo that together you are stronger. 

When you activate Star Rage, you can share its benefits with one willing creature within your reach by spending 10 Cursed Energy.

## Level 20: Perfected Virtual Mass (Technique Improvement)
You have reached the peak of virtual mass. 

Creatures now make saving throws against your Cursed Technique with disadvantage, unless their Strength score is higher than your Cursed Energy DC.

Additionally, while benefiting from Star Rage, your unarmed strikes overcome resistances, but not immunities.

## Technique Reversal: Virtual Mass Decrease
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Due to your mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique, you have learned to reverse the mass increase. This allows you to expel all the mass in your body. You can enter this state as a bonus action or a reaction, spending as much Cursed Energy as you choose. For every point of Cursed Energy spent, your movement speed increases by 3 meters. This state lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a free action. Once per turn while in this state of lower mass, when you hit a target with a melee attack, the damage increases by 1 for every meter you have moved.

This feature cannot be used in tandem with Star Rage.

***Zero Virtual Mass.*** Despite the power of your reversal, there is a limit. If you spend more than 20 Cursed Energy, your mass is reduced to 0. This causes you to enter an incorporeal state and halves your maximum hit points. While in this state, you become unaffected by all damage, except psychic, and can phase through objects and creatures. You also cannot interact with other creatures or objects. Additionally, your speed increases by 10 meters. This state lasts for 1 minute or until stopped as a free action. F or the entire duration of the state and, until the end of your next turn after the state ends, you cannot regain hit points.
