As a user of the Blazing Courage, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Blazing Courage (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to ignite your weapon in flames, boosting your fire power. 

As a bonus action, while holding a melee weapon, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) in cursed energy to set the weapon on fire for 1 minute. For the duration, the weapon deals 1d6 fire damage per energy spent on a hit. Additionally, you emit bright light within 1 meter and dim light within 3 meters.

You can deactivate this effect at will (no action required).

If you are from Tokyo, you cannot increase this feature’s damage with the 3rd or 7th-level features.

Additionally, you gain the Cursed Weapon Enhancement. When using your Lapse technique while Cursed Weapon Enhancement is active, the damage type changes to fire instead of necrotic damage.

At 5th level, you deal 1d8 fire damage per energy spent. This increases to 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

## Level 3: Soulfire Stance (Technique Improvement)
Your technique is fueled by your heart, and no obstacle can stand in the way of your blazing flames. 

If your weapon is suffering from any penalties due to being broken or damaged, those penalties are removed when you activate Blazing Courage, and they remain gone until the technique ends.

While Blazing Courage is active, you can spend 3 Cursed Energy as an action to create an aura of flames within a 3-meter radius centered on you, which lasts for 1 minute. 

While the aura is active, you gain resistance to cold and fire damage. Any creature that enters the aura or starts its turn within it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes double your Blazing Courage damage dice in fire damage. On a successful save, they take half as much damage. If they fail by 5 or more, they suffer First Degree burns.

## Level 6: Extensive Flames (Technique Improvement)
When you unleash your full power, your flames extend and grow stronger. 

Whenever you spend the maximum amount of cursed energy possible while using Blazing Courage, your weapon’s reach increases by 1 meter. Additionally, if you miss an attack by 2 or less, the target takes half the amount of additional fire damage it would have taken. If a creature has Endurance, they do not take any additional damage.

At 11th level, this effect applies if you miss by 3 or less. At 17th level, it applies if you miss by 4 or less, and at 20th level, it applies if you miss by 5 or less.

## Level 10: Intense Heat (Technique Improvement)
Your flames burn brighter and stronger than ever, leaving no enemy unscarred after a combat encounter with you. 

Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon enhanced by Blazing Courage, they must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they suffer [First Degree burns](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Burned). On a success, they receive no additional conditions. If they fail by 5 or more, they suffer [Second Degree burns](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Burned).

If the attack is a critical hit, the creature makes the saving throw with disadvantage. On a failure, they receive [Second Degree burns](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Burned), and if they fail by 5 or more, they suffer [Third Degree burns](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Burned).

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Hell Wave (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Your technique was simple to understand, but Tokyo saw your potential to be something greater. You have now created an extension technique that unleashes a massive wave of flames, destroying everything in its path. 

As an action, by spending 10 cursed energy, you force all creatures in a 10-meter cone to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 11d10 fire damage, are knocked prone, and receive [Second Degree burns](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Burned). On a success, they take half as much damage, are not knocked prone, but still receive [First Degree burns](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Burned). Creatures with Endurance do not suffer any effects on a successful save.

This technique deals maximum damage to objects and structures, igniting any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

At 17th level, the damage increases to 15d10, and at 20th level, it increases to 20d10.

## Level 20: Inferno Sorcerer (Technique Improvement)
Your flames have reached their peak, now standing as a symbol of your unstoppable courage. 

You ignore resistance to fire damage when dealing damage with your Innate Technique. Additionally, creatures with Endurance are still affected by your Extensive Flames feature.

## Technique Reversal: Freezing Resolve
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Your mastery of Reverse Cursed Technique has unlocked your cursed technique reversal, allowing you to imbue your weapon with ice instead of fire.

You can spend up to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) in cursed energy as a bonus action while holding a melee weapon, freezing the weapon for 1 minute. For the duration, the weapon deals 2d6 cold damage on a hit per 2 energy spent.

At 5th level, you now deal 2d8 cold damage per energy spent. This increases to 2d10 at 11th level, and to 2d12 at 17th level.

You can deactivate this effect at will (no action required).

If you are from Tokyo Jujutsu High, you cannot increase this feature’s damage with the 3rd or 7th level features.

If you use your Reversal while Cursed Weapon Enhancement is active, the damage type changes to cold instead of necrotic damage.

***Coldsteel Poise.*** At 6th level, you have mastered extending your ice beyond your blade and repairing your weapon. If your weapon is suffering from any penalties due to being broken or damaged, those penalties are removed when you activate Freezing Resolve, and they remain removed until the technique ends.

Additionally, while Freezing Resolve is active, you can spend 6 Cursed Energy as an action to emit an aura of ice within a 3-meter radius centered on you, which lasts for 1 minute. While the aura persists, you gain resistance to cold and fire damage. Any creature that enters the aura or starts its turn within it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take twice your Freezing Resolve damage dice in cold damage. On a success, they take half as much damage. If they fail by 5 or more, they become [Chilled](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Chilled) for 1 minute. Creatures may repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of their turns to end the Chilled condition.
