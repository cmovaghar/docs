As a user of the Missile Fists, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Missile Fists (Lapse Technique)
You can unleash massive fists as a method of attack. 

You gain the Martial Arts feature of the Jujutsu Sorcerer class early (at level 1 instead of level 2). 

As a bonus action, you can spend 2 Cursed Energy to create a fist that is twice as big as your normal fists for 1 minute or until you use them to attack. Each fist requires a ranged cursed energy attack roll and replaces an attack in the attack action against a creature within 20 meters of you. On a hit, the target takes damage equal to your unarmed strike damage, increased by one dice tier.

This cannot replace attacks from the Cursed Blast of Blows feature. The damage from this feature cannot be increased by features from the Tokyo school.

You can spend an additional amount of cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier to create additional fists, creating one additional fist for every 2 cursed energy spent. 

At 5th level, you can create fists equal to your Charisma modifier + half your Charisma modifier. 

At 11th level, you can create fists equal to twice your Charisma modifier. 

At 17th level, you can create fists equal to twice your Charisma modifier + half your Charisma modifier. 

At 20th level, you can create fists equal to thrice your Charisma modifier.

## Level 3: Detonating Assault (Technique Improvement)
Your onslaught becomes destructive. Whenever you hit a creature with one of your summoned fists, creatures within 1 meter of the impact take half of the damage caused by the fist as thunder damage.

## Level 6: Cataclysmic Barrage (Extension Technique)
You can unleash a wave of fists summoned in a 20-meter cone. 

As an action for 10 Cursed Energy, each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take damage equal to your Lapse Technique’s damage a number of times equal to half the number of fists summoned (rounded down, minimum of 1) and are pushed back an amount of meters equal to 2 times your Strength modifier. On a success, they take half damage and are not pushed back.

This technique deals twice as much damage against objects and structures.

## Level 10: Precision Strike (Technique Improvement)
Your targeting precision improves. 

When using your Technique, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier that are unaffected by your technique. If you hit a creature with your Missile Fists, you can reroll one damage die. 

Additionally, you can now add damage from Cursed-Empowered Strikes to the total damage of your technique.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Titan's Grasp (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Your mastery of Missile Fists allows you to summon a massive fist capable of manipulating your surroundings and controlling the battlefield. 

As an action for 6 Cursed Energy, you can conjure a giant spectral fist within 20 meters of you, which lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it. This fist can perform the following actions:

### Grasping Crush
The fist attempts to restrain a creature within range. Make a melee cursed energy attack roll contested by the target’s Athletics or Acrobatics check. On a success, the creature is restrained, and the fist holds them in place until the start of your next turn.

### Barrier Fist
The fist interposes itself between you or an ally and incoming danger, granting the target three-quarters cover until the start of your next turn. Additionally, the fist can absorb damage equal to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus before vanishing.

### Fist Lift
You can use the fist to lift or move a creature or object within range. The fist can carry a creature or object weighing up to 5 times your carrying capacity, moving it up to 10 meters to a point within the fist’s range. If the target is unwilling, they must succeed on a Strength saving throw to avoid being moved.

The spectral fist counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances, but it deals no damage unless used in conjunction with another Missile Fists technique.

## Level 20: Devastating Fists (Technique Improvement)
Your Lapse Technique has reached its pinnacle, enabling you to summon immense fists with unmatched efficiency.

When using your Lapse Technique, the cost to summon each fist is reduced to just 1 Cursed Energy. The damage of each fist is now equal to your unarmed strike damage, plus an additional amount twice that value. Additionally, you can spend Cursed Energy equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to imbue each fist with cursed strikes. Finally, you gain the following effect:

***Cataclysmic Detonation.*** When you hit a creature with at least three fists in a single turn, you can choose to release a powerful shockwave. All creatures within 10 meters of the target must make a Strength saving throw against your Cursed Energy save DC. On a failed save, they take thunder damage equal to the total damage dealt by the fists and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half the damage and are not knocked prone.

## Technique Reversal: Foot Shield
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

After mastering the Reverse Cursed Technique, you gain a defensive ability. 

As a reaction to being attacked, you can spend a number of Cursed Energy equal to or less than your Charisma modifier to summon a large foot in front of you. The foot has hit points equal to 10 times the amount of Cursed Energy spent, and its Armor Class is equal to your Cursed Energy Save DC. 

The foot absorbs damage on your behalf, automatically failing any saving throws. This foot remains until its hit points are depleted or until the beginning of your next turn.
