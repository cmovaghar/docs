As a user of Inverse, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Inverse (Lapse Technique)
You gain the ability to invert the damage you take. 

As a bonus action, you can spend 2 cursed energy to activate Inverse for 1 minute. While Inverse is active, any damage you take is modified according to a set damage limit and a threshold. The damage limit is equal to your proficiency bonus multiplied by your Charisma score, and the threshold is equal to your proficiency bonus multiplied by your Charisma modifier.

When you take damage that exceeds your threshold, subtract the threshold from the damage and take the remaining difference as damage. However, if the damage is below your threshold, subtract the damage from your set limit and take the resulting number as damage instead.

For example, if your set limit is 100 and you take 90 damage, you subtract the threshold from the damage if it exceeds the threshold (e.g., 90 - 20 = 70), and you take the remaining 70 damage. If the damage is below the threshold (e.g., 10 damage), subtract the damage from your set limit (100 - 10 = 90), and you take 90 damage instead. If the result of the calculation is a negative number, the damage remains unchanged.

You can extend the duration of Inverse by spending 1 cursed energy at the end of the 1-minute duration to maintain the effect for an additional minute.

## Level 3: No Damage (Technique Improvement)
You’ve learned to further manipulate the damage you take based on its intensity. If you take damage below your threshold, you become vulnerable to that damage. However, if the damage exceeds your threshold, you gain resistance to it, even if the damage would normally bypass resistances or immunities.

For example, if your threshold is 15 and you take 10 damage, you treat it as 20 damage due to your vulnerability. But if you take 18 damage, you instead halve it due to your resistance, even if that damage type would normally ignore resistances.

## Level 6: Didn't Break a Sweat (Technique Improvement)
You’ve become skilled at manipulating damage based on its intensity, even when making saving throws. When you are forced to make a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the difficulty of the save depends on whether the damage is above or below your threshold.

If the damage is above your threshold, you have advantage on the saving throw, regardless of the damage type. If the damage is below your threshold, you have disadvantage on the saving throw, as weaker attacks become more dangerous to you.

For example, if your threshold is 15 and you take 18 damage from a fireball, you gain advantage on the saving throw. However, if you take 10 damage from the same attack, you would roll with disadvantage instead.

## Level 10: Quick Inversion (Technique Improvement)
Staying with your technique active for long periods of time can sometimes be a disadvantage, so you have trained to access it more easily. You can now use your technique as a reaction to an attack or saving throw directed at you. Additionally, you can deactivate your technique early as a reaction.

Furthermore, you gain additional reactions equal to half of your proficiency bonus (rounded up), which can only be used for the Inverse technique. At 17th level, this is upgraded to your proficiency bonus number of reactions.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Inverted Field
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

While training with your technique, you discovered that you have more to offer than just being an indestructible powerhouse. 

You have learned how to alter an entire area to be affected by your technique. As a bonus action, by spending 8 cursed energy, you can cause all objects and creatures within 10 meters of you to be affected by your Inverse technique for 1 minute. You can deactivate this field as a bonus action.

## Level 20: Hardest Wall and Lightest Glass (Technique Improvement)
You have fully mastered your Inverse technique, allowing you to withstand devastating attacks while weak strikes take a heavy toll. 

When you take damage, the effect depends on whether it exceeds or falls below your threshold.

If the damage exceeds your threshold, you reduce it by an amount equal to your jujutsu sorcerer level. However, if the damage is below your threshold, you increase the damage taken by an amount equal to your jujutsu sorcerer level. This mastery makes you nearly invulnerable to powerful blows, but even the lightest strike can prove perilous.

## Technique Reversal: Power Inversion
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have learned to reverse your technique, allowing you to invert the damage of your own attacks. As a bonus action, for 4 cursed energy, you activate Power Inversion for 2 minutes. While active, when you deal damage, it is modified based on a set damage limit and a threshold. The set damage limit is equal to your proficiency bonus multiplied by your Charisma score, and the threshold is equal to your proficiency bonus multiplied by your Charisma modifier.

When you deal damage that exceeds your threshold, you subtract the threshold from the damage and deal the remaining difference as damage. However, when the damage is below your threshold, you subtract the damage from your set limit and increase the damage dealt by that amount. If the calculation results in a negative number, the damage remains unchanged.

For example, if your set limit is 80 and you deal 100 damage, you would subtract the threshold from the damage if it exceeds it (e.g., 100 - 20 = 80), dealing the remaining 80 damage. Conversely, if you deal 10 damage and your threshold is 20, you would subtract that amount from your set limit (80 - 10 = 70), resulting in dealing 70 damage instead.

You can spend 2 cursed energy at the end of the 2 minutes to maintain the effect for an additional 2 minutes.
