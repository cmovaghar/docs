As a user of Love Rendezvous, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Love Rendezvous (Lapse Technique)
You have developed a complex technique and learned the basics of how to use it. As a free action, when you touch a creature or object (this can include yourself) that has Cursed Energy, or as part of hitting with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 Cursed Energy to mark the target's Cursed Energy with a star of your choice. Only one star can be placed on one creature's Cursed Energy at a time, but the same star can be applied to multiple creatures’ Cursed Energy at once. You can mark up to a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier with the same star. When you mark a creature, everything that has their Cursed Energy—like shikigami, cursed tools, etc.—is also marked. The following stars are available to mark: ★Imai, ★Acrux, ★Mimosa, ★Ginan, and ★Gacrux.

When you mark a creature, a sparking light will appear above their head. They can also spot the star’s name marked on their body if they make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your Cursed Energy DC.

Anyone marked with a star must follow a sequential order if they wish to approach another star. When they move, they must go directly toward the next star in order and touch it, which allows them to move on to the next star. If they fail to follow the order, they cannot close the distance to their target, though they still expend any movement. The technique will then cause all objects and creatures marked with the same star to be drawn toward the point with the highest Cursed Energy, rapidly throwing them at that point. The highest Cursed Energy source will take 1 die of bludgeoning damage for every 5 feet the other stars traveled and their size, while the objects and creatures that crash into it will take half as much damage. If the creature follows the correct order, nothing happens, and the stars they’ve touched disappear. Once they’ve touched all the stars in the correct order, the stars on them vanish.

|Size|Damage Die|
|:-|:-:|
|Tiny|d4|
|Small|d6|
|Medium|d8|
|Large|d10|
|Huge|d12|
|Gargantuan|2d12|

The star order is as follows: ★Imai → ★Acrux → ★Mimosa → ★Ginan → ★Gacrux. If a creature has shikigami summoned, the shikigami are marked with the same stars as the summoner. If a creature marked with a star attempts to target you with a Cursed Energy attack roll or forces you to make a saving throw, the attack instead targets them, forcing them to roll against their own AC if it’s an attack roll, or against their own DC if it’s a saving throw. As long as the Cursed Energy of the feature belongs to the mark, the feature cannot close the distance between you and it, preventing you from taking damage as long as they are wrong. For example, if a creature marked with ★Imai tries to target a creature marked with ★Ginan with a Cursed Energy ray without having gone through ★Acrux and ★Mimosa, the ray will instead target the ★Imai until they follow the correct order.

If there is no possible path for a target to follow the order, the target is unaffected by the technique until a path is created. Once a path becomes possible, the target is affected again. For example, if ★Gacrux is placed before ★Ginan for a creature marked with ★Acrux, the technique no longer functions for that creature, as there’s no way to touch ★Ginan without going through ★Gacrux first. Once the creature passes ★Gacrux, allowing them to approach ★Ginan, the technique functions again, and they must touch ★Ginan before continuing to ★Gacrux.

The stars last for 10 minutes or until you remove one or more of them at will.

Creatures won't know they’re being affected by the technique until they suffer the consequences of not following the order. Afterward, they can make the Perception check to detect the star. Once they identify the star, they can make a Wisdom (Insight) check with disadvantage against your Cursed Energy DC to understand your technique, unless they have the Cursed Energy Tracker feat or are familiar with the Southern Star Constellation, in which case they roll normally.

***Effective Marking.*** At 5th level, you learn to mark creatures more quickly and efficiently. You may now mark creatures with stars as a reaction. Additionally, you gain a number of additional reactions equal to your Charisma modifier that can only be used to mark other creatures.

## Level 3: Gravity Force (Technique Improvement)
Your technique's attraction has grown stronger. 

The damage from creatures colliding now overcomes resistances to bludgeoning damage, though it does not bypass immunities.

Additionally, when creatures marked with stars collide due to your technique, they take additional damage equal to the damage die of their size.

## Level 6: Shining Stars (Technique Improvement)
You have become more proficient with your technique, now able to place more stars. 

The number of stars you can apply of the same type is increased to twice your Charisma modifier.

## Level 10: Cosmic Pull (Technique Improvement)
Your understanding of the gravitational forces between the stars has deepened, improving how your marked targets interact.

When creatures marked with stars collide due to the attraction of your technique, they must make a Strength saving throw against your Cursed Energy DC. On a failed save, the affected creatures are knocked prone and have disadvantage on their next attack roll or saving throw.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Shooting Stars (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Facing tougher opponents has made it harder to touch them, so you developed a method to counter this. 

As a bonus action, you can spend 4 Cursed Energy to target up to 4 creatures within 30 feet of you and throw small stars at them. Make a ranged Cursed Energy attack roll for each target. On a hit, the target is marked with one star of your choice.

## Level 20: Universal Force (Technique Improvement)
Your technique's attraction now feels like a black hole. 

Marked creatures and objects take force damage instead of bludgeoning damage when they are attracted to each other. It still overcomes resistances, but not immunities.

Additionally, the number of creatures you can mark with the same star is increased to three times your Charisma modifier.

## Technique Reversal: Hateful Separation
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Due to your mastery over the Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked your Cursed Technique reversal, now making your technique repel instead of attract. When you use Love Rendezvous, you may spend 2 Cursed Energy to instead turn it into Hateful Separation, causing the order of the stars to be inverted.

Anyone marked with a star must now follow the reversed sequential order if they want to approach another star. When they move, they must go directly toward the previous star in order and touch it, which allows them to proceed to the next star in reverse order. Failing to do this will prevent them from closing the distance to their target, though they still expend any movement until the technique is disabled. The objects, creatures, and Cursed Energy marked with the same star will be repelled toward the creature with the lowest Cursed Energy, all rapidly launched toward that point.

The creature with the lowest Cursed Energy will take 2 dice of bludgeoning damage for every 3 meters the other stars have traveled and their size, while the objects and creatures that are repelled and crash into the target will take half as much damage. If the marked creature follows the correct reversed order, nothing happens, and the stars they’ve touched disappear. Once they touch all the stars in the reversed order, the stars on them vanish.

See the following chart for the measure of damage:

|Size|Damage Die|
|:-|:-:|
|Tiny|d4|
|Small|d6|
|Medium|d8|
|Large|d10|
|Huge|d12|
|Gargantuan|2d12|

The reversed order of the stars is as follows: ★Gacrux → ★Ginan → ★Mimosa → ★Acrux → ★Imai.

If a creature has shikigami summoned, the shikigami are marked with the same stars as the summoner's. If a creature marked with a star attempts to target you in the incorrect reversed order with a Cursed Energy attack roll or forces you to make a saving throw against a feature, the attack or feature is repelled toward the creature with the lowest Cursed Energy. For attack rolls, the attacker instead targets the creature with the lowest Cursed Energy, rolling against their AC. For saving throws, the repelled effect forces the attacker to roll against the DC of the creature with the lowest Cursed Energy.

As long as the Cursed Energy of the feature belongs to the mark, the feature cannot close the distance between the attacker and their intended target, allowing the intended target to take no damage from the attack as long as the reversed sequence is violated.

For example, if ★Gacrux attempts to target ★Acrux with a Cursed Energy ray without first moving through ★Ginan and ★Mimosa, the Cursed Energy ray will instead be repelled toward the creature with the lowest Cursed Energy in the area. This repulsion continues until the attacker follows the reversed sequence correctly.
