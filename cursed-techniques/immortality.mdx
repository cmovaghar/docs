As a user of Immortality, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Immortality (Lapse Technique)
Your innate technique has made you immortal. 

You are immune to death by old age, though you continue to age normally, and magical aging can still affect you.

Every 500 years, you must assimilate yourself with a Star Plasma Vessel. The process is a one-hour ritual, during which you and the vessel must be in physical contact. After the hour passes, the vessel will die and merge with you, granting you another 500 years of life.

If you fail to complete the ritual in time, you will "evolve" into something that is neither curse nor human. Your race will change to Cursed Spirit, but you will not gain any of its racial traits or qualify for its feats. While your appearance will become more curse-like, you will retain a humanoid form.

## Level 3: Experienced (Technique Improvement)
You have learned a great number of skills over time, thanks to the vast amount of free time you've had. 

You gain proficiency in four skills, tools, or languages of your choice. You may mix and match the proficiencies you select (for example, you could choose 2 skills and 2 languages).

Additionally, you gain proficiency in one more skill, tool, or language at 5th level, 11th level, and again at 17th level.

## Level 6: Expert (Technique Improvement)
While learning many skills is beneficial, you also have more than enough time to fully master them. 

You gain expertise in four skills or tools of your choice. As before, you may mix and match the proficiencies you select.

Additionally, you gain expertise in one more skill or tool at 8th level, 14th level, and finally at 17th level.

## Level 10: Free Time (Technique Improvement)
With so much free time on your hands, learning comes effortlessly. 

During any downtime, you can choose a Cursed Feat that is not a body feat, Taijutsu feat, or a weapon feat. Over this period, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, with the DC determined by the DM. If you succeed on the check, you can ignore one prerequisite of that feat, as long as it doesn’t involve another feat, a specific race, a required innate technique, or another class.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Prolonged Lifespan (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You’ve developed an extension technique that allows you to remain useful even in battle. 

As a reaction to falling to 0 hit points, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to instead drop to the hit points you had two rounds ago. For example, if you fall to 0 hit points this round, and two rounds ago you had 24 hit points, you can choose to fall to 24 hit points instead.

## Level 20: Unrivaled Wisdom (Technique Improvement)
Although you did not evolve your technique, your mind surpasses all others due to your exceptional wisdom.

You gain expertise in any skill or tool you are already proficient in. Additionally, the DC for learning anything is reduced by your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (your choice).

## Technique Reversal: Mortality
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have mastered the reversed version of your technique. Instead of maintaining your own immortality, you can now bring the curse of death to others. 

Whenever you hit with an unarmed strike or touch a creature, you may spend Cursed Energy equal to twice your Charisma modifier to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature ages a number of years equal to the amount of Cursed Energy spent. On a successful save, they do not age.
