As a user of the Disaster Tides, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

<Note>
	Due to its versatility, anything involving the manipulation of water will be considered a Lapse Technique.
</Note>

## Level 1: Flowing Cursed Energy
Your Cursed Energy flows like the tides. 

When you activate your Cursed Armor, you gain resistance to cold and fire damage. Additionally, when dealing damage with the Curse-Empowered Strikes or Cursed Weapon Enhancement feature, you can choose to change its damage type to cold.

You also gain a swimming speed equal to twice your walking speed and are unaffected by difficult terrain caused by non-magical water. Starting at 6th level, while underwater, you can spend 1 Cursed Energy as a free action to reset the time required for you to drown.

## Level 1: Death Swarm (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to create an endless array of shikigami from your imagination. 

As an action, you can spend X Cursed Energy to summon a number of sea shikigami up to your Charisma modifier within 3 meters. The strength of the creatures you summon depends on your level. The summoned Death Swarm shikigami last for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier.

Starting at 6th level, they remain until they die or until you complete a long rest outside your domain. Outside your domain, you can have only a number of shikigami summoned at once equal to your Charisma modifier plus your proficiency bonus.

|Shikigami|Cost|Level Required|
|:-|:-|:-:|
|[Tiny Sea Shikigami](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Tiny_Sea_Shikigami_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|1 Cursed Energy per Shikigami|1|
|[Small Sea Shikigami](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Small_Sea_Shikigami_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|2 Cursed Energy per Shikigami|1|
|[Medium Sea Shikigami](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Medium_Sea_Shikigami_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|4 Cursed Energy per Shikigami|1|
|[Large Sea Shikigami](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Large_Sea_Shikigami_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|6 Cursed Energy per Shikigami|4|
|[Huge Sea Shikigami](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Huge_Sea_Shikigami_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|8 Cursed Energy per Shikigami|6||
|[Gargantuan Sea Shikigami](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Gargantuan_Sea_Shikigami_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|10 Cursed Energy per Shikigami|10|

These creatures automatically take their attack actions upon being summoned and act on your turn. If summoned within your Domain Expansion, they gain a sure-hit effect, and there is no limit to the number of shikigami you can summon.

## Level 3: Water Manipulation (Lapse Technique)
You’ve mastered the basics of your Hydrokinesis technique, allowing you to develop various applications. 

You gain two of the following water manipulations.

At 6th, 10th and 17th level, you gain an additional water manipulation. 

### Wave Ride
As a bonus action, you can spend 4 Cursed Energy to surf on your own water. 

For a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier, your movement speed doubles, and you remain 3 meters above the ground. 

Once per turn, if you move into a creature’s space, they must make a Strength saving throw against your Cursed Save DC. On a failure, they take 2d8 bludgeoning damage, are pushed back 5 meters, and knocked prone. On a success, they take half damage, are pushed back 3 meters, and do not fall prone. Creatures with a swimming speed have advantage on this saving throw.

### Torrent Boost
When you jump, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier in Cursed Energy to propel yourself with water from your hands, feet, or both. You travel an extra 3 meters per energy spent.

### Water Bullet
When making an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 Cursed Energy to fire a water bullet from your finger at a creature within 26 meters, making a ranged cursed energy attack roll. 

On a hit, the attack deals your unarmed strike damage one tier higher as piercing damage. 

Before firing, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier in Cursed Energy to add 1d8 damage per energy spent.

### Whirlpool
As an action, you can spend 2 Cursed Energy to spill water in a 10-meter cone, forcing all creatures in the area to make a Strength saving throw.

On a failure, they take 2d8 cold damage and are pushed to the cone’s edge, where they must then make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, they take half damage and are not pushed. 

If they fail the Constitution saving throw, they take 3d10 cold damage and are pulled within your reach. On a success, they take half damage and are not pulled. 

This technique's damage increases as follows: 4d8 + 5d10 at 5th level, 7d8 + 8d10 at 11th level, 10d8 + 12d10 at 17th level, and 12d8 + 15d10 at 20th level.

### Wave Push
As an action, you can spend 4 Cursed Energy to raise a 10-meter-wide, 10-meter-tall, 10-meter-long wave within 1 meter of you and launch it forward. 

The wave moves 6 meters per round on initiative count 20 until it travels 40 meters or hits a wall. Creatures within 5 meters of the wave must make a Strength saving throw, taking 4d8 bludgeoning damage and being caught by the wave on a failure, or half damage and avoiding capture on a success. 

Captured creatures repeat the save at the start of their turns, taking the damage again and remaining caught on a failure, or escaping without further damage on a success. If a creature collides with a wall while caught in the wave, they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 3 meters traveled. Creatures with a swimming speed have advantage on this save. 

This technique’s damage increases to 6d8 and 1d8 per 10 feet traveled at 5th level, 10d8 and 1d10 at 11th level, 12d8 and 1d12 at 17th level, and 14d8 at 20th level.

### Water Burst
As an action, you can spend 4 Cursed Energy to unleash a highly pressurized burst of water in a 6-meter cone. 

Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failure and becoming blinded for 1 minute. Blinded creatures can repeat the save at the start of their turns. On a success, they take half damage and are not blinded. 

This technique’s damage increases to 6d6 at 5th level, 9d6 at 11th level, 13d6 at 17th level, and 18d6 at 20th level.

### Water Cut
As an action, you can spend 8 Cursed Energy to swing your arms, launching razor-sharp blades of water in a 3-meter-wide, 24-meter-long line. 

Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 slashing damage on a failure or half damage on a success. 

This technique’s damage increases to 7d8 at 5th level, 10d8 at 11th level, 14d8 at 17th level, and 18d8 at 20th level.

### Water Tendril
As a bonus action, you can spend 3 Cursed Energy to create a water tendril and make a melee cursed energy attack roll against a creature within 12 meters. 

On a hit, the tendril deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage. The tendril lasts for 1 minute, and you can use your bonus action to attack with it. You can create additional tendrils up to your proficiency bonus, each costing the same amount of energy. 

If you have at least one tendril, your unarmed strikes gain an additional 12 meters of reach. 

Each time you take damage, one tendril is destroyed. This technique’s damage increases to 2d8 at 5th level, 4d8 at 11th level, 6d8 at 17th level, and 8d8 at 20th level.

### Wetlands
As an action, you can spend 4 Cursed Energy to release a surge of water, transforming the ground within 20 meters into difficult terrain. 

Creatures that take the Dash action within this area must make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

### Water Grenade
As an action, you can spend 6 Cursed Energy to create a condensed sphere of water in your hand and throw it anywhere within 24 meters. 

Upon impact, it explodes in a 6-meter radius, forcing creatures in the area to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 4d8 bludgeoning damage and are launched 10 meters to the edge of the radius, falling prone. If they collide with a surface, they take 3d6 additional bludgeoning damage. On a success, they take half damage, are launched only half the distance, and do not fall prone or take collision damage. 

This technique’s damage increases to 6d8 and 6d6 at 5th level, 8d8 and 8d6 at 11th level, 10d8 and 10d6 at 17th level, and 14d8 and 12d6 at 20th level.

## Level 6: Advanced Water Manipulation (Extension Technique)
You have refined your control over water, allowing for more powerful techniques with greater precision. 

You gain three of the following water manipulation techniques.

You may select an additional water manipulation technique at 10th level and another at 17th level.

### Piercing Water 
You create a concentrated water beam designed to strike an opponent’s internal organs. 

As an action, you can spend 4 cursed energy to make a ranged cursed energy attack roll against a creature within 10 meters. 

On a hit, they take 2d10 cold damage plus 2d6 piercing damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are knocked prone; on a success, they remain standing. 

The damage increases to 4d10 + 4d6 at 11th level, 7d10 + 7d6 at 17th level, and 11d10 + 11d6 at 20th level.

### Flooding
You generate a massive surge of water beneath you, filling the area. 

As an action, you can spend 6 cursed energy to flood a closed space of up to 30 meters in diameter with water up to 3 meters deep. If the area is smaller, the water level rises accordingly. 

All creatures in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take 4d10 cold damage plus 4d6 bludgeoning damage, are knocked prone, and are rapidly carried to the walls of the space. On a success, they take half damage, remain standing, and are only pushed halfway. 

Any creature that collides with an object or structure while being carried by the water takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage per 3 meters traveled. This technique deals double damage to objects and structures.

The water lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier and is considered difficult terrain for creatures without a swimming speed. 

The damage increases to 6d10 + 6d6 at 11th level, 10d10 + 10d6 at 17th level, and 15d10 + 15d6 at 20th level. 

### Geysers
You create massive water eruptions at chosen points, sending powerful jets of water into the air. 

As an action, you can spend 8 cursed energy to create a number of geysers equal to your Charisma modifier within sight range. Creatures within 1 meter of a geyser must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 6d12 cold damage and are launched 10 meters into the air. On a success, they take half damage and remain grounded. 

If a creature is in the area of multiple geysers, they make only one saving throw, taking damage from only one geyser. However, the DC increases by 1 for each additional geyser affecting them.

The damage increases to 10d12 at 11th level, 16d12 at 17th level, and 24d12 at 20th level. 

### Jet Blows
You enhance your strikes by releasing bursts of water from your elbows and heels.

Whenever you make an unarmed strike, you can spend cursed energy up to your proficiency bonus, adding 1d8 damage of the same type per cursed energy spent. 

This technique does not benefit from Tokyo Jujutsu High increases and bonuses.

### Jet Deflection
As a reaction to an incoming melee or ranged attack, you can spend cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier to fire a water jet at the attacker or projectile, dealing 1d12 cold damage per cursed energy spent. 

If deflecting a ranged attack, you reduce its damage by the amount rolled. If you match or exceed the incoming damage, the attack is nullified. 

If deflecting a melee attack, you reduce its damage by the amount rolled. If you match or exceed the attack’s damage, the attacker takes the difference and must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they are pushed 40 feet back, or half that distance on a success. At 11th level, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier plus half your Charisma modifier (rounded down). 

At 17th level, you can spend twice your Charisma modifier. At 20th level, you can spend three times your Charisma modifier. 

This technique does not benefit from Tokyo Jujutsu High increases and bonuses.

### Water Missile
As an action, you can spend 6 cursed energy to envelop yourself in water, shaping it into a missile and launching yourself forward.

You gain a flying speed equal to twice your movement speed and must use all of it during your turn. 

Any creature you collide with must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d12 bludgeoning damage on a failure, plus an additional 1d12 for every 3 meters traveled. On a success, they take half damage. Objects take double damage. 

You can only move in a straight line during this technique, using 5 meters of movement to change direction. 

By spending 4 cursed energy at the end of your turn, you can maintain this technique. 

You do not provoke opportunity attacks while moving, and a creature can take damage from this technique only once per turn.

### Water Bazooka
As an action, you can spend 10 cursed energy to form a heavy, condensed sphere of rotating water between your hands and fire it at a creature within 30 meters. 

Make a ranged cursed energy attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 10d10 bludgeoning damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take an additional 6d8 bludgeoning damage and are launched 10 meters back. On a success, they take half damage and are not pushed back. 

If the initial attack misses, the sphere strikes the ground and explodes, forcing all creatures within 10 meters to make a Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 6d10 bludgeoning damage, while those who succeed take half damage. 

The damage increases to 12d10 + 8d6 at 11th level, 16d10 + 10d6 at 17th level, and 18d10 + 12d6 at 20th level.

### Hydro Explosion
As a bonus action for 6 cursed energy or a reaction for 8 cursed energy, you release an omnidirectional burst of water from your body. 

Every creature within 6 meters must make a Strength saving throw, taking 6d10 bludgeoning damage and being launched 12 meters back on a failure, or half damage and half the distance on a success. 

If used as a reaction against a melee attack, the damage is reduced by two dice, but the attacker is launched 20 meters back on a failure and 10 meters on a success. 

The damage increases to 8d10 at 11th level, 10d10 at 17th level, and 14d10 at 20th level.

### Needle Rain
As an action for 10 cursed energy, you launch a massive volume of water into the air, which then descends as high-pressure raindrops. 

Choose a point within 80 meters. Every creature within a 30-meter radius must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 piercing damage on a failure and half damage on a success. 

The damage increases to 12d10 at 11th level, 15d10 at 17th level, and 18d10 at 20th level.

### Water Bind
As an action for 6 cursed energy, you can target up to three creatures within 10 meters, sending torrents of water to wrap around them. 

Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained as the water coils around them. Restrained creatures take 4d8 slashing damage at the start of each turn they remain restrained. They can make a Strength saving throw at the end of their turns to break free. 

The damage increases to 6d8 at 11th level, 10d8 at 17th level, and 12d8 at 20th level.

## Level 10: Water Defensive Ring (Extension Technique)
You can create a protective ring of water that shields you from incoming attacks. 

As an action, you can spend 4 Cursed Energy to form a ring of water around yourself, granting temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier × 20. Alternatively, you can activate this ability as a reaction to any incoming damage (except psychic) for 6 Cursed Energy.

While the ring is active, you gain immunity to cold damage and resistance to fire, bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage. Additionally, you can convert the water from the ring into energy—by removing 5 hit points from the shield, you can substitute 1 Cursed Energy required for a cursed technique. This effect does not work with Death Swarm.

You cannot use this ability again until the current ring is depleted, and you cannot have both this feature and Cursed Armor active at the same time.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Massive Swarms (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have developed a method to unleash a true swarm of death. When using Death Swarm, you can choose to summon a massive swarm of sea shikigami instead of summoning them individually. You summon one swarm in place of the usual number of shikigami, with the available swarms listed below.

|Shikigami|Cost|
|:-|:-|
|[Tiny Sea Shikigami Swarm](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Tiny_Sea_Shikigami_Swarm_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|4 Cursed Energy|
|[Small Sea Shikigami Swarm](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Small_Sea_Shikigami_Swarm_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|6 Cursed Energy|
|[Medium Sea Shikigami Swarm](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Medium_Sea_Shikigami_Swarm_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|12 Cursed Energy|
|[Large Sea Shikigami Swarm](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Large_Sea_Shikigami_Swarm_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|18 Cursed Energy|
|[Huge Sea Shikigami Swarm](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Huge_Sea_Shikigami_Swarm_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|24 Cursed Energy|
|[Gargantuan Sea Shikigami Swarm](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Gargantuan_Sea_Shikigami_Swarm_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|30 Cursed Energy|

## Level 20: Supreme Manipulation (Extension Technique)
You have reached the pinnacle of water manipulation. Choose one of the following ultimate techniques:

### Final Tsunami
As an action for 20 Cursed Energy, you summon a towering wall of water from the ground and send it crashing toward your enemies. 

The wave is 100 meters long, 100 meters high, and 15 meters thick. Any creature within the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take 20d10 bludgeoning damage; on a success, they take half as much.

At the start of each of your turns, the wall moves 15 meters away from you, carrying any creatures caught inside it. Creatures inside or those the wall moves through must make another Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take 20d10 cold damage and are knocked prone; on a success, they take half damage and remain standing. A creature can only take this damage once per round.

At the end of each turn, the wall’s height is reduced by 15 meters, and the damage dealt on subsequent rounds decreases by 1d10. Once the wall reaches 0 feet, the technique ends. Creatures within the tsunami can attempt to swim, but they must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check against your cursed energy DC to move. If they fail, they remain trapped. A creature that escapes falls to the ground.

This technique deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Final Whirlpool
As an action for 25 Cursed Energy, you spin rapidly while drawing in a massive amount of water, creating a colossal whirlpool. 

The vortex is 100 meters tall with a 60-meter radius. All creatures within range (except you) must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take 15d10 cold damage + 15d10 bludgeoning damage, and their movement speed is reduced to 0. On a success, they take half damage but are still caught in the current.

Creatures trapped in the whirlpool are continuously thrashed, taking 20d10 cold damage at the start of their turns. They may then attempt a Strength saving throw to reposition themselves, reducing the next turn’s damage by 2 dice. This reduction stacks each turn.

The whirlpool lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier, with the damage decreasing by 3 dice per round. You may move freely during this time, carrying the vortex with you. You are immune to all effects of this technique. 

### Drown
As an action for 30 Cursed Energy, you conjure multiple water spheres that engulf the heads of up to a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier within 12 meters. Affected creatures must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn. On a failure, they gain one Drown Counter; on a success, they gain a negative Drown Counter.

A creature can accumulate a number of Drown Counters equal to their Constitution modifier +1. Upon reaching this limit, they begin to suffocate, immediately dropping to 0 hit points and making death saving throws as the water sphere bursts.

To get rid of the bubble, they must reach the appropriate number of negative counters, following this table: 

|Constitution Modifier|Negative Counter Amount|
|:-|:-:|
|If you have a +0 in Constitution|6|
|If you have a +1 in Constitution|5|
|If you have a +2 in Constitution|4|
|If you have a +3 in Constitution|3|
|If you have a +4 in Constitution|2|
|If you have a +5 in Constitution|1|

### Final Torrent
As an action for 30 Cursed Energy, you gather an immense amount of water into a condensed, high-pressure sphere before launching it forward in a devastating blast. 

All creatures in a 60-meter-long, 25-meter-wide line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 20d12 cold damage + 20d12 bludgeoning damage. On a success, they take half damage.

Creatures hit are pushed to the end of the line. On a failed save, they are launched an additional 25 meters beyond the endpoint.

## Technique Reversal: Water Destruction
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Through your study of Reverse Cursed Technique, you have learned to invert your abilities, allowing you to destroy water instead of creating it.

As an action, you can spend 2 Cursed Energy per 50 liters of water destroyed, affecting up to an amount equal to 10 times your Charisma modifier within an open container or natural source within range. Alternatively, you can disperse fog in a 10-meter cube within range.

You may also use this ability to dehydrate living beings. As an action, you can spend up to twice your Charisma modifier in Cursed Energy to touch a creature within reach that has an open wound, whether from a slashing or piercing attack taken in the last round, the Bleeding condition, or any other source of exposed injury. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 2d8 necrotic damage per Cursed Energy spent. On a success, they take half as much. If they fail the save by 5 or more, they also gain 1 level of exhaustion.

This ability does not affect creatures that lack water in their bodies.

At 17th level, you can spend up to three times your Charisma modifier, and at 20th level, you can spend up to four times your Charisma modifier.
