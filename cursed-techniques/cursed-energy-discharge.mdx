As a user of the Cursed Energy Discharge, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Highest Output
Your cursed energy output remains the same, whether or not you are using your innate technique. 

If you are in technique burnout, you can still use your innate technique without needing to make the saving throw, and you do not suffer the reductions caused by burnout. This does not apply to your Domain Expansion.

At 11th level, your cursed energy output has only improved with time. You gain the Improved Cursed Energy Output cursed feat.

At 17th level, your cursed energy output has become legendary in the history of jujutsu! You gain the Legendary Cursed Energy Output cursed feat. If you already possess this feat, you instead gain the Divine Cursed Energy Output cursed feat.

## Level 1: Cursed Energy Discharge (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to fire powerful beams of cursed energy. 

You gain the Cursed Energy Ray cursed feat. Additionally, the amount of Cursed Energy you can spend on this feat is doubled.

While using this feature, you can split the Cursed Energy Ray into a number of beams up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). This action doubles the range of the beams, and you must make a separate ranged cursed energy attack roll for each. When splitting your Cursed Energy Ray, you may choose how to distribute the total damage across the beams. For example, if a Cursed Energy Ray deals 5d12 Necrotic damage and you split it into two beams, one could deal 2d12 while the other deals 3d12, or one could deal 4d12 while the other deals 1d12.

When you apply your Tokyo School bonuses to this technique, the bonus affects the total damage of the Cursed Energy Ray, not each individual beam. For example, if you add an extra 4d12 damage through a Tokyo bonus, it will increase the total damage of the Cursed Energy Ray, not each beam by 4d12.

***Defensive Discharge.*** At 5th level, you learn to use your beams defensively, potentially mitigating damage. Whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use a cursed energy attack roll or saving throw as a reaction, targeting the attacker. If the result of your roll deals more damage than the creature's attack roll plus twice the attack's damage, the attack is negated.

You may also use your Lapse technique alongside this feature.

***Charge.*** At 11th level, your technique allows for even greater output. You have discovered that by concentrating, you can charge even more cursed energy into a blast! Once per turn, as a bonus action, you can choose to start concentrating on Cursed Energy Ray. You can concentrate in this way for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. During this concentration, you cannot use any cursed energy-related features.

Once you successfully concentrate for at least one round, or when your maximum number of rounds passes, you can stop concentrating (no action required) and fire a ranged cursed energy attack roll or saving throw.

For every round you have concentrated, the maximum amount of cursed energy you can spend on the Cursed Energy Ray is increased by 2.

## Level 3: Redirective Blasts (Technique Improvement)
Youâ€™ve created an extension to ensure that you never miss your target.

Whenever you miss a ranged cursed energy attack roll using your Innate Technique, you can spend 2 Cursed Energy to reroll the attack roll.

When attacking this way, the attack rolls ignore cover.

At 5th level, you can now use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) per turn.

## Level 6: Barrage of Fire (Technique Improvement)
You have learned how to overpower your opponents by sending a barrage of blasts.

If you make all of your ranged cursed energy attack rolls using your Innate Technique against a single target, the rolls are made with advantage. If the target has a passive perception higher than your Cursed Energy DC, the rolls are not made with advantage.

Additionally, if you make two or more ranged cursed energy attack rolls using your Innate Technique against a single target, the critical hit range for all of those attacks is lowered by 1 (this bonus does not stack for every additional two beams).

Lastly, you do not roll with disadvantage on your ranged cursed energy attack rolls using your Innate Technique, even if you are within 1 meter of a hostile creature.

Level 10: Granite Blast (Extension Technique)
You have created the most powerful technique in your arsenal, a blast that fully utilizes your immense output. 

As an action, you can spend 10 cursed energy to make a ranged cursed energy attack roll (with a 20/80 modifier) against a target within range. On a hit, the target takes 12d12 necrotic damage. This blast also affects any objects or structures within 1 meter of the target.

While using this technique, you may spend additional cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier, adding a d12 to the total necrotic damage and increasing the range by +10 for each point of cursed energy spent.

If you spend at least 5 additional cursed energy, you can choose to make this attack a cone, forcing all creatures within range to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take the full damage and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half damage and are not knocked prone.

When the technique is used in this form, it deals double the damage to objects and structures.

At 11th level, you may spend additional cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier plus half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down). At 17th level, this increases to your Charisma modifier added twice, and at 20th level, it increases to your Charisma modifier added three times.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Godly Output (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have reached the pinnacle of your technique, entering a state where your output is always at its maximum. 

As an action, you can spend 10 cursed energy to enter your Godly Output state for 1 minute. While in this state, the amount of cursed energy you can spend on features is increased by your Charisma modifier. You gain advantage on all cursed energy attack rolls, and creatures must make saving throws against your abilities with disadvantage.

## Level 20: Perfect Output (Technique Improvement)
You have learned how to maximize the efficiency of your cursed energy output. 

Whenever you spend 1 cursed energy on a feature related to your cursed technique, it counts as if you have spent 2 instead. However, this cannot be used to exceed the normal limit of damage dice; for example, if you can only spend 4 cursed energy on a feature, spending 2 will not allow you to exceed this limit.

Additionally, you no longer need a specific body part to release your beams, allowing you to use them even if you are incapacitated.

## Technique Reversal: Cursed Energy Recharge
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

After mastering Reverse Cursed Technique, you have learned how to reverse your cursed technique to regain cursed energy. 

Whenever you are the target of a cursed energy effect, you can attempt to absorb the cursed energy being used as a reaction. To do so, make a Constitution saving throw with the DC equal to 10 + half the cursed energy spent in the effect, before any reductions. 

If you succeed on the saving throw, you regain cursed energy equal to the amount spent. Additionally, if the effect was a cursed energy attack roll or forced a saving throw, the effect is negated. If the effect was a melee attack roll, you nullify any features of it that are powered by cursed energy.

If you fail the saving throw, you regain no cursed energy and take damage. If the effect forces a saving throw, you automatically fail the saving throw for the effect you were attempting to absorb. If the effect uses a melee attack roll or a cursed energy attack roll, it automatically becomes a critical hit.

This feature cannot absorb Domain Expansions.
