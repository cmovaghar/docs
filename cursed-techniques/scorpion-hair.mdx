As a user of the Scorpion Hair, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Poisonous Cursed Energy
Due to your innate technique, you have developed a strong connection to poison. 

When you activate your Cursed Armor Enhancement, you gain resistance to poison damage. 

Additionally, when you deal damage with the Curse-Empowered Strikes, Cursed Strike, or Cursed Weapon Enhancement features, you can choose to change the damage type to poison damage.

## Level 1: Scorpion Hair (Lapse Technique)
You have developed a unique and surprisingly powerful innate technique. 

Your hair grows longer, and you must keep it tied in a large ponytail for the technique to function properly. The tip of your hair forms into a sharp, scorpion-like stinger. Once per turn, as part of your attack action, you can spend 1 cursed energy to replace an attack with your scorpion hair. Make a melee cursed energy attack roll, and on a hit, the attack deals 1d8 piercing damage. Additionally, when you use your scorpion hair to make an attack, your reach increases by 1 meter.

At 11th level, you can replace more than one attack in the attack action with this feature.

At 3rd level, the damage increases to 1d10, to 1d12 at 6th, to 2d8 at 10th, to 2d10 at 17th, and to 2d12 at 20th level.

## Level 3: Swift Maneuvers (Technique Improvement)
You have become more skilled in using your hair in combat, and you can now perform the following maneuvers:

***Hair Grab.*** When you hit with a scorpion tail attack, you can choose to deal no damage in exchange for attempting to grapple the target. While grappling a creature with your hair, you cannot use your scorpion hair to attack any other creature outside of the grappled target.

***Vital Strike.*** As part of making a scorpion hair attack, you can spend 2 cursed energy to aim for a vital point on the target. On a hit, the attack deals additional damage equal to the base piercing damage of your scorpion hair.

***Scorpion Defense.*** As a reaction, you can spend 4 cursed energy to make a melee cursed energy attack roll against an attacker who is targeting you.

## Level 6: Scorpion Poison (Technique Improvement)
Your hair has increasingly taken on the characteristics of a scorpion, now imbued with poison at its tip.

Whenever you hit a creature with your scorpion hair, you can spend an additional 5 cursed energy to force the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 poison damage and is poisoned. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not poisoned. The target can attempt the Constitution saving throw again at the start of each of their turns, ending the condition on a success.

At 11th level, the poison damage increases to 6d10, to 7d10 at 17th, and to 8d10 at 20th level.

## Level 10: Stronger Poisons and Adept Maneuvers (Technique Improvement)
Your poison has become more potent and deadly. 

Whenever a creature fails the Constitution saving throw against your poison, they also gain the envenomed condition for 1 minute. They may attempt the saving throw again at the beginning of each of their turns to end the envenomed condition early.

***Improved Maneuvers.*** Along with the enhancement of your poison, you have become much more proficient in using your hair in combat. You gain the following maneuvers:

***Stinger Step.*** As an action, you can spend 4 cursed energy to move up to your movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks. During this movement, you can make one scorpion hair attack against any creature you pass within your reach. This maneuver can also be used in conjunction with your reversal technique, Scorpion Antidote.

***Scorpion Stance.*** As a bonus action, you can spend 3 cursed energy to enter a defensive stance until the beginning of your next turn. Whenever a creature enters your reach for the first time on a turn, you may make one scorpion hair attack against them.

***Disarming Sting.*** For 3 cursed energy, when you hit a creature with an attack using your hair, you can force them to make an Athletics or Acrobatics check (the creature's choice) against your attack roll. On a failure, you can disarm them of one object they are holding.

***Death's Embrace.*** As part of grappling a creature, you can spend 6 cursed energy to attempt to squeeze the life out of them. The target must make a Strength saving throw against your Cursed Energy DC. On a failed save, they take your unarmed strike damage and are restrained. The creature can attempt a Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns to break free. While restrained, the creature takes your unarmed strike damage at the start of each of its turns.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Poison of the Scorpion King (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have discovered how to enhance your poison further. It has evolved into a far more lethal form, causing the target's body to decay. 

Whenever you deal poison damage with your Scorpion Hair, the target will take additional poison damage at the start of their turns while they are poisoned by you. This additional poison damage is equal to Xd10, where X is your Charisma modifier.

## Level 20: Death Sting (Extension Technique)
You have reached the pinnacle of your poison, making it so deadly that a single sting could end your opponent’s life. 

The poison damage dealt by your technique now ignores resistance. 

Additionally, if the target fails the Constitution saving throw, they gain one level of exhaustion.

## Technique Reversal: Scropion Antidote
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Your mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique and poisons has allowed you to develop a cursed technique reversal. 

You can now use your hair as an antidote instead of a poison. Once per turn, as part of your attack action, you can spend cursed energy to make an additional attack with your scorpion hair. However, this attack does not deal extra damage. Instead, it causes one effect of your choice, with varying costs.

For 3 cursed energy:

- You can heal 3d8 + your Charisma modifier hit points.
- End one disease or condition. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

For 5 cursed energy:

- You can heal 5d8 + your Charisma modifier hit points.
- Reduce a target’s exhaustion level by 1.
- End one effect causing the charmed or petrified condition.
- End one curse affecting the target.
- End any reduction to the target’s ability scores.
- End one effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum.
- Grant the target advantage on Dexterity or Strength attacks, saves, and checks for 1 minute.
