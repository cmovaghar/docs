As a user of the Helicopter Hair, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Helicopter Hair (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to transform your hair into helicopter blades, granting you the ability to fly. 

As a bonus action, you can spend 2 Cursed Energy to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute. While flying with this technique, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action. 

At the end of the minute, you can spend 1 additional Cursed Energy to continue flying for 1 more minute.

## Level 3: Helicopter Blades (Extension Technique)
You have learned to extend the blades of your helicopter hair, allowing you to use it as a weapon to slice through enemies. 

As an action, you can spend 3 cursed energy to extend the blades and attempt to slash a foe. Make a melee cursed energy attack roll against a creature within 1 meter of you. On a hit, you deal 4d8 slashing damage.

The damage increases as you gain levels: it becomes 6d8 at 5th level, 8d8 at 11th level, 10d8 at 17th level, and 12d8 at 20th level.

## Level 6: Blade Rush (Extension Technique)
You have learned a new way to use your hair. Instead of using it to fly upwards, you can now shift it to the side and propel yourself toward an enemy. 

As an action, you can spend 8 cursed energy to dash forward in a 3-meter-wide, 20-meter-long line. Enemies within this line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 15d10 slashing damage on a failed save. On a successful save, they take half as much damage.

This technique deals double damage to objects and structures. The damage increases to 18d10 at 11th level, 22d10 at 17th level, and 25d10 at 20th level.

## Level 10: Fortunate Son (Technique Improvement)
You have begun to master your hair technique. 

While flying with your helicopter hair, you no longer provoke opportunity attacks, and your flying speed is now twice your walking speed.

Additionally, when using your helicopter blades, the range of your attack increases to 3 meters.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Wind Tunnel (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned a new way to use your Blade Rush. Instead of rushing forward, you now blast air in the same direction. 

As an action, you can spend 3 cursed energy to unleash a blast of air in a 3-meter-wide, 40-meter-long line. Creatures in the targeted area must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed back to the end of the 40 meters. Creatures pushed in this way take 2d6 bludgeoning damage for every 3 meters they are pushed. On a successful save, they are pushed back only 20 meters and take no damage.

## Level 20: Black Hawk (Technique Improvement)
Your hair has improved once again. 

When transformed into a flying speed, your walking speed now triples. Additionally, your helicopter blades have become more powerful. They now have a range of 5 meters, and you can make two attacks when using them.

## Technique Reversal: Airboat Hair (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Having mastered the Reverse Cursed Technique, you can now use your cursed technique reversal in a new way. 

You can transform your hair into an airboat. As a bonus action, you can spend 4 cursed energy to gain a faster walking speed, equal to twice your flying speed. While in this form, you can ignore difficult terrain and do not provoke opportunity attacks. 

This form lasts for 1 minute. While active, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action. At the end of the minute, you can spend 1 additional cursed energy to keep the technique active for 1 more minute.

While this technique is active, you can spend 4 cursed energy when taking the Dash action to force any creatures you pass by to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 4d8 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not knocked prone.
