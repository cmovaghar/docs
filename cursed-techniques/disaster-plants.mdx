As a user of the Disaster Plants, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Plant Manipulation (Lapse Technique)
You have learned how to create and manipulate basic plants.

***Binding Plants.*** As an action, you can spend 2 Cursed Energy to ensnare a target within 10 meters with binding plants. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they become Restrained until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, they are unaffected.

If the target fails the save by 5 or more, they remain Restrained for 1 minute instead. In this case, they can repeat the saving throw at the beginning of each of their turns, ending the condition early on a success.

You can target up to two creatures at 5th level, three at 11th, four at 17th, and five at 20th level.

***Thorn Whip.*** As an action, you can spend 1 Cursed Energy to create a long, thorn-covered vine that lashes out at a creature within 5 meters. Make a melee cursed energy attack roll against the target. On a hit, the creature takes 1d6 Piercing damage, and if it is Large or smaller, you pull it up to 2 meters closer to you.

This damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 11th, 7d6 at 17th, and 11d6 at 20th level.

***Poisonous Plants.*** As an action, you can spend 2 Cursed Energy to extend your hand toward a creature within 2 meters, releasing a puff of noxious gas from a plant that sprouts on your palm. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 1d8 poison damage. On a success, they take half damage. If they fail the save by 5 or more, they also become Poisoned.

This damage increases to 2d8 at 5th level, 4d8 at 11th level, 7d8 at 17th, and 11d8 at 20th level.

Additionally, any techniques you use that create objects or structures with hit points have an AC equal to your Cursed Energy DC. If a feature increases the DC of a technique, such as Chanting or Maximum Output, the object's or structure's AC increases accordingly.

## Level 3: Roots (Extension Technique)
Through an extension of your techniques, you've learned how to make roots sprout from the ground. You can use one of the following techniques.

***Entangling Roots.*** As an action, you can spend 3 Cursed Energy to cause roots to sprout from the ground in a 4-meter square within 20 meters of you. All creatures in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they become Restrained for 1 minute. On a success, they are not restrained. A creature restrained by the roots can use its action to make a Strength check against your Cursed Energy save DC. On a success, it breaks free. For the duration, the area becomes difficult terrain. When the technique ends, the roots wilt away.

***Path of Roots.*** As a free action, you can spend 1 Cursed Energy to create a path of roots for movement. You generate a line up to 30 meters long and 1 meter wide, capable of supporting up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) times 50 kg. The path lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) or until you dismiss it (no action required). The roots have hit points equal to your Charisma modifier times 5.

At 5th level, the length increases to 60 meters and the width to 2 meters. At 11th level, the length increases to 90 meters and the width to 5 meters. At 17th level, the length increases to 120 meters and the width to 4 meters. At 20th level, the length increases to 150 meters and the width to 10 meters.

***Piercing Roots.*** As an action, you can spend 3 Cursed Energy to make roots sprout in a 10-meter cone in front of you, forcing each creature in the area to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 2d10 piercing damage. On a success, they take half damage.

The damage increases to 4d10 at 5th level, 7d10 at 11th level, 11d10 at 17th level, and 16d10 at 20th level.

***Wall of Roots.*** As a reaction, you can spend 4 Cursed Energy when you or an ally is targeted by an attack roll or a cone/line saving throw. You create a wall of roots that is 2 meters tall and 1 meter wide, covering an area 2 meters around you. The wall has hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) times 10.

At 5th level, the hit point maximum increases to your Charisma modifier times 15. At 11th level, it increases to your Charisma modifier times 20. At 17th level, it increases to your Charisma modifier times 25, and at 20th level, it increases to your Charisma modifier times 30.

## Level 6: Wooden Ball (Extension Technique)
You have learned how to create small wooden balls that can be launched to pierce your opponents. 

As an action, you can spend 2 Cursed Energy to create one wooden ball. The ball has hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier and will hover around you.

As a bonus action, you can send one or more of your wooden balls toward a target within 10 meters. Make a ranged Cursed Energy attack roll. On a hit, the balls grow large branches that pierce through the target, dealing 1d12 Piercing damage. After they hit or miss, after 1 minute, or when destroyed, the balls disappear.

You can spend additional Cursed Energy up to your Charisma modifier, creating one additional wooden ball per point of energy spent. You may use your action to command all wooden balls at once.

***Flying Ball.*** You can spend your bonus action to hover above one of your wooden balls within 1 meter of you, gaining a flying speed equal to your walking speed while above it.

The damage from this technique increases to 3d12 at 11th level, 6d12 at 17th level, and 10d12 at 20th level.

## Level 10: Flower Field (Extension Technique)
You can create a circle of flower petals that surrounds your opponents, robbing them of their will to fight. 

As an action, you can spend 6 Cursed Energy to choose a point within 30 meter of you. All creatures within a 2-meter radius centered on that point must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, their will to fight is completely shattered as their mind enters a state of tranquility and happiness, rendering them unable to take any actions that would affect the battle for 1 minute. On a success, nothing happens.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Cursed Bud (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have studied the true nature of your innate technique, allowing you to create a new type of plant that feeds on cursed energy. 

As an action, you can spend 8 Cursed Energy to create and launch a number of cursed buds equal to your Charisma modifier toward one or more targets within 20 meters of you. Make a ranged Cursed Energy attack roll for each bud. On a hit, the bud attaches itself to the target. At the start of the creature's turns, it loses Cursed Energy equal to your Charisma modifier. If the creature has no Cursed Energy remaining, it loses hit points instead.

The creature can use its action to make a Strength check to remove the cursed bud, ending the effect on a success.

***Cursed Bud Tree.*** As a full-action, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to create a large tree of cursed buds that lasts for 1 minute. At the beginning of your turns, you can use a bonus action to have the tree launch a number of cursed buds equal to half your Charisma modifier, making ranged Cursed Energy attack rolls against creatures within 10 meters of the tree. The tree has hit points equal to your Charisma modifier times 10 and receives a +5 bonus to its AC. It is also vulnerable to Slashing and Fire damage.
While in this state, attack rolls against the creature are made with advantage, and they have disadvantage on saving throws. If the creature is forced to make a saving throw or suffers an attack, it can remake the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Additionally, every time a creature fails the save for Flower Field, the DC for that creature is decreased by 1. After succeeding on the saving throw, the creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours.

## Level 20: Radiant Beam (Extension Technique)
You have learned an immensely powerful technique that harnesses the power of the sun. 

As an action, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to create a 30-meter long, 1-meter wide line of energy. All creatures in this line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 20d10 Necrotic damage and are Blinded for 1 minute. On a success, they take half damage and are not blinded.

If a creature fails by 5 or more, they are also Confused until the beginning of your next turn.

The creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns to end the condition early on a success.

## Technique Reversal: Decay
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Your mastery of Reversed Cursed Technique has granted you the ability to reverse your technique, now able to decay the world's flora, causing it to wither and die.

As an action, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to unleash a wave of decay, causing all plants and plant-based creatures within a 10-meter radius to wither and die. Nonmagical plants immediately wither and die, while plant-based creatures must make a Constitution saving throw against your Cursed Energy save DC. On a failure, they take 5d12 Necrotic damage. On a success, they take half as much damage.

***Withering Plant.*** You can implant a plant into a creature and cause it to decay from within, dealing internal damage. As an action, if a target has been affected by a Slashing or Piercing attack in the last round, is under the Bleeding condition, or has an open wound, you may spend an amount of Cursed Energy up to twice your Charisma modifier to make a melee attack roll and implant any type of flora into their body, causing it to decay wildly. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 Necrotic damage per Cursed Energy spent. On a success, they take half damage.

At 17th level, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier plus three times, and at 20th level, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier plus four times.
