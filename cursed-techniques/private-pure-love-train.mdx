As a user of Private Pure Love Train, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Domain Expansion - Idle Death Gamble
Your technique is extremely unique, as it comes with a Domain Expansion.

Your Domain Expansion costs no cursed energy the first time you cast it. However, the cursed energy cost increases by 3 for each subsequent casting, up to a maximum of 30. This increase in the Domain Expansion's cost resets after you complete a long rest. 

Additionally, you may expand your Domain as a free action, instead of the normal action cost. 

Whenever you activate your Domain Expansion, no creatures may react to it due to its incredibly fast activation speed.

<Note>
	You may change or re-flavor the events and designs of your Domain Expansion however you wish, while it will still function the same mechanically as it is currently written.
</Note>

The sure-hit effect of your Domain is the complete explanation of everything regarding how it works towards the targeted creature. This process is entirely harmless and does not hinder the creature in any way.

The Domain starts off in Normal Mode, where you and the creatures are placed in a neutral stage. Once it begins, you may perform one of the following visual effect indicators:

***Shutter Doors.*** As an action or bonus action, for 1 cursed energy, you create two doors between yourself and a target within 10 meters. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being crushed between them. On a failure, they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage and are restrained. On a success, they take half damage and their movement speed is halved. The damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 11th level, 7d6 at 17th level, and 11d6 at 20th level.

***Closed Doors.*** As a reaction, for 4 cursed energy, you can summon your Shutter Doors in front of a ranged or melee attack, or a projectile, making them slam shut. You add your Charisma modifier (to a maximum of +5) to your AC for that attack. Additionally, you may use this against a line saving throw, adding half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down) to the saving throw. You can also use it to stop a creature from moving. As a reaction to a creature moving at least 3 meters within 24 meters of you, you can summon the doors in front of them, attempting to halt their movement. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, they continue as normal; on a failure, they are stopped and can only move half the distance they normally could.

***Reserve Balls.*** As an action or bonus action, for 1 cursed energy, you throw a ball and make a ranged cursed energy attack roll against a target within 40 meters of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 11th level, 7d6 at 17th level, and 11d6 at 20th level.

***Consecutive Effects.*** As a reaction to an attack hitting you, you can perform a pseudo-spin for 1 cursed energy. The attack is rerolled. If the attack misses, it is considered a miss for all features and effects, and you gain one pseudo-spin multiplier. Once you reach a pseudo-spin multiplier of 4, you gain a Jackpot. Upon exiting your Domain or if an attack affected by this reaction hits you, the pseudo-spin multiplier resets to zero.

While inside your Domain Expansion, these moves are unaffected by the Sure Hit feature.

The doors and balls can appear in various colors, indicating a greater chance of landing a Jackpot. Rainbow-colored indicators or missing four consecutive attacks with Consecutive Effects guarantee a Jackpot, with a 1d6 roll to determine whether the guaranteed Jackpot is even or odd.

When you make a Shutter Door, Reserve Ball attack, or use Closed Doors, you must roll a d20 to determine their color, as outlined below:

|Number Rolled|Color|Amount of Rerolls|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1-10|Green|2|
|11-15|Red|4|
|16-19|Gold|6|
|20|Rainbow|-|

After making a Shutter Door or Reserve Ball attack, or using Closed Doors, you must roll 3d6. You may reroll these dice a number of times equal to the rerolls granted by the color of the attack. If you roll three identical numbers, you achieve a Jackpot. Otherwise, you are returned to Normal Mode. Once per turn, if you roll two identical numbers, you enter Riichi Mode, triggering the start of an Event.

You must then roll a d20 to determine the type of event. The d20 roll gains a bonus equal to the number of rerolls provided by the color of your Domain attack.

|Number Rolled|Event|Event Description|Percentage Bonus|
|:-:|-|-|:-:|
|[1-9]|Transport Gate|"Will the main character be able to cross the gate before it closes?" If a Jackpot occurs, he manages to pass through the gate in time.|2|
|[10-14]|Passenger Seat Competition|"Will the main character be able to take the seat and sit down?" If a Jackpot occurs, he is able to sit down.|4|
|[15-18]|Bear the Squeeze for the Bathroom|"The main character took the wrong train and it won't stop. Will he be able to hold it the whole trip to go to the bathroom?" If a Jackpot occurs, the protagonist can hold it and go to the bathroom.|6|
|[19-20]|Last Train at Friday Night|"The main character and his lover leave after work, but on the way home, he ends up missing the train. Did she manage to catch it?" If a Jackpot occurs, the heroine misses it as well, and they meet at the station.|8|

When an Event occurs, you must roll another 3d6. If you roll three identical numbers, you achieve a Jackpot. Otherwise, you are returned to Normal Mode. However, while rolling the 3d6 during an Event, you gain a percentage bonus, which is part of the Event you're currently experiencing. You can distribute this bonus to make the 3d6 all equal numbers. For example, if you roll a 1, a 3, and a 6, and have a percentage bonus of 8, you may remove 5 from the bonus to turn the 1 into a 6, and remove 3 from the bonus to turn the 3 into a 6, making all the numbers equal with a set of three 6s.

***Jackpot Bonus.*** Upon winning a Jackpot, your Domain Expansion ends. However, you do not suffer from Technique Burnout. Instead, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- You gain the effects of the Improved Reverse Cursed Technique feat as if you had spent your level in cursed energy at the start of the round.
- You receive twice your level in cursed energy at the beginning of your turns.
- Your hit points cannot drop below 1 for the duration of the bonus, unless you would be killed outright (e.g., by massive damage or having your head destroyed).
- You gain +2 to your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma scores, including their maximums, for the duration of the bonus.

You gain refinement through the Domain Casualties method whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points while benefiting from a Jackpot Bonus. Your Domain cannot be expanded while under the effects of a Jackpot Bonus.

## Level 3: Riichi Hype! (Technique Improvement)
You love gambling so much that you can bring segments of your Domain into the outside world. 

You can now use the Shutter Doors and Reserve Balls attacks, as well as the Closed Doors reaction, even outside of your Domain Expansion. They function the same way as they would within your Domain Expansion. However, the target must be within line of sight, and if you trigger an Event or Jackpot with these attacks, it will only occur if you expand your Domain.

## Level 6: Probability Change and Time-Reduction (Technique Improvement)
You have evolved as a sorcerer and discovered that your Domain has even more to offer once you hit the Jackpot.

When you expand your Domain Expansion after hitting a Jackpot, you are sent into either Probability Change Mode or Time Saving Mode. You enter Probability Change Mode if the number rolled for your previous Jackpot was odd, and Time Saving Mode if the previous Jackpot was even.

You gain the following benefits depending on the Mode you enter when using your Domain Expansion:

***Probability Change Mode.*** This mode guarantees a Jackpot when you use your Domain’s attacks. The first Shutter Door, Reserve Ball attack, or Closed Doors reaction you use is automatically rainbow-colored, without needing to roll for the attack’s color.

***Time Saving Mode.*** This mode speeds up the spinning process, increasing your chances of hitting a Jackpot, though it does not guarantee one. You can now trigger Events twice per turn instead of once. Additionally, when rolling the 3d6 to determine if you score a Jackpot, you gain a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus, which can be distributed among the rolls. For example, if you roll a 1, a 2, and a 3 for the 3d6, and your proficiency bonus is 3 (at 6th level), you can adjust the rolls. You may subtract 2 from your proficiency bonus to add 2 to the 1 from the 3d6, making it a 3, and subtract 1 from your proficiency bonus to add 1 to the 2 from the 3d6, turning it into a 3. With a set of 3s, you land an odd Jackpot and gain the benefits of doing so. If you do not land a Jackpot while in this mode, you are sent back to Normal Mode the next time you perform your Domain Expansion.

## Level 10: Perfect Timing (Technique Improvement)
You have perfect timing when it comes to using Consecutive Effects, allowing you to avoid damage almost entirely. 

You gain additional reactions equal to half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down), and these can only be used for making Consecutive Effect reactions.

Additionally, you can spend 4 cursed energy instead of 1 when using a Consecutive Effect to impose disadvantage on the attacker’s rerolled attack.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - You Need Skill to Win at Luck (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Whenever you play, you expect to win. 

If you have not landed a Jackpot the last time you used your Domain Expansion or at the start of a combat encounter, you may spend 10 cursed energy to remove a number from the 3d6 rolled for Events or Jackpots.

## Level 20: Perfected Domain (Technique Improvement)
You have mastered your cursed technique, achieving an unbeatable Domain Expansion. 

Your Jackpot Bonus now lasts for 2 minutes instead of 1, and the cost of expanding your Domain increases by 1 instead of 3 per use, up to a maximum of 30.

Additionally, your current Domain Expansion refinement is doubled.

## Technique Reversal: Bust
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Your mastery over the Reverse Cursed Technique has granted you the ability to reverse your technique. 

Whenever you successfully score a Jackpot, you may choose to forgo all the benefits it would provide in order to reduce your cursed energy and the cursed energy of one creature that was inside your Domain when you scored the Jackpot, which you then convert into a Bust. 

For 1 minute, at the start of each turn, both you and the creature lose cursed energy equal to twice your Charisma modifier.
