As a user of the Hakuna Laana, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Hakuna Laana (Lapse Technique)
You’ve learned to dance to the rhythm etched in your body. 

As a bonus action, you can spend 3 cursed energy to enter Hakuna Laana for 1 minute. While in this state, you gain advantage on any ability checks or saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. Additionally, while Hakuna Laana is active, you gain advantage on saving throws against a cursed technique or any feature that costs cursed energy, and you impose disadvantage on ranged cursed energy attack rolls and melee cursed energy attack rolls made against you.

At 5th level, you gain proficiency in Performance checks, or expertise if you are already proficient.

## Level 3: Curse Expelling Improvement (Technique Improvement)
You’ve become more skilled in your use of Hakuna Laana. 

While within Hakuna Laana, you now reduce melee cursed energy attack rolls and ranged cursed energy attack rolls against you, as well as the DCs of saving throws you make due to cursed techniques or features that cost cursed energy, by half of your Charisma modifier, rounded down.

## Level 6: Physical Improvement (Technique Improvement)
The increase to your physical capabilities has also improved, making you a true monster in hand-to-hand combat. 

While in Hakuna Laana, you add half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down) to any ability check, saving throw, attack roll, or damage roll made using Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

## Level 10: Dancing Improvement (Technique Improvement)
Your dance has almost reached its peak. 

You now use your full Charisma modifier instead of just half for your Curse Expelling Improvement and Physical Improvement features. 

Additionally, while Hakuna Laana is active, you increase your Armor Class by half of your Charisma modifier, rounded down.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - In The Rhythm (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You’ve greatly expanded upon your technique, deciding to boast more, to the point where not just you are trapped in your rhythm, but your enemies as well. 

When a hostile creature misses an attack against you or you succeed on a saving throw against a hostile creature’s effect due to the effects of Hakuna Laana, you gain one rhythm counter. 

You can have a number of rhythm counters equal to your Charisma modifier, and all rhythm counters disappear at the end of your turn. 

While in Hakuna Laana, you gain a bonus to your melee weapon attack rolls equal to the number of rhythm counters you possess.

## Level 20: There Are No Curses (Technique Improvement)
You’ve reached the apex of your technique, a dance that practically erases the cursed. 

The Armor Class increase from Dancing Improvement is now equal to your full Charisma modifier, and you gain a damage threshold equal to your jujutsu sorcerer level. 

This threshold is doubled against cursed technique features and features that cost cursed energy. 

If an attack’s damage is ignored because of this threshold, it is treated as having missed you, and if a saving throw’s damage is ignored due to the threshold, you are treated as having passed the saving throw.

## Technique Reversal: The Curse of Moping Around
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have mastered Reverse Cursed Technique, unlocking your cursed technique reversal. Dancing is your essence, and your reversal forces you to stop dancing, which makes you incredibly sad. 

As a bonus action, you can cease using your technique and spend 6 cursed energy to enter this new sad form for 1 minute. 

While in this form, you have disadvantage on all saving throws, attack rolls are made with disadvantage, and attacks against you have advantage. 

However, this overwhelming sadness amplifies your negative emotions and generates more cursed energy. At the beginning of each of your turns, you regain cursed energy equal to your Charisma modifier, but this regeneration only works if you are in combat where your life is in danger. 

You can deactivate your reversal early as a free action, but you will not regain cursed energy for that turn.
