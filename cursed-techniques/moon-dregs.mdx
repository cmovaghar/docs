As a user of the Moon Dregs, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Moon Dregs (Lapse Technique)
You have learned how to summon a poisonous, jellyfish-like shikigami. 

As an action, for 3 Cursed Energy, you can summon Moon Dregs within 1 meter of you. You control it using the Summon Commanding Rules. You can only have one Moon Dregs at a time.

Once its hit points are reduced to 0, it is dismissed. You can summon it again for the same cost, but once it has been reduced to 0 hit points a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you must take a short or long rest before summoning it again. Additionally, you may choose to make it any size smaller than its original size when you summon it, or you may change its size as a bonus action after summoning it. At 6th level, you can also choose to make it Huge, and at 20th level, Gargantuan.

***Shikigami Empowerment.*** Moon Dregs grows stronger alongside you and gains the following benefits:

- It gains an additional hit die equal to your Charisma modifier.
- Its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores each increase by your Charisma modifier.
- All of its damaging features have their damage die tier increased by your Charisma modifier.
- It gains a flying speed equal to 3 times your Charisma modifier in meters.

#### Traits
***Invisible Force.*** This creature is entirely made out of cursed energy, meaning it cannot be seen by normal people. Creatures without levels in the Jujutsu Sorcerer class or who cannot see into the ethereal plane cannot see it. Although, if these creatures were in a life and death situation (less than half their maximum hit points), they gain the ability to see it. 

***Cursed Weapons.*** The creature's weapon attacks are magical. 

***Enhanced Vitality.*** Moon Dregs gains an additional d10 of HP for each level his summoner has above 1.

***Debilitating Poison.*** Moon Dregs is an extremely poisonous shikigami, but its poison is not just harmfulâ€”it also inflicts several detrimental effects on the target depending on the severity of its endurance. Whenever a creature fails Moon Dregs' poison saving throw, it suffers the following effects based on how much it failed by:
- The target loses 2 meters of its movement speed if it fails by 1 or more. For every additional -1 the target fails by, it loses 3 more meters of movement speed, to a minimum of 0.
- The target is knocked prone if it fails by 2 or more. The target must spend a bonus action to stand up.

The target remains affected by these effects for 1 minute, with the opportunity to repeat the Constitution saving throw at the beginning of its turns, ending the effects on a success. Even if the target shakes off the effects, it is still poisoned. If the target is hit by Moon Dregs' Tentacles or stingers, it must make another Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned again.

***Body Protection.*** Moon Dregs can use an action or reaction to swallow a willing creature, allowing the creature to remain inside its body. Creatures inside Moon Dregs are under the effects of full cover and can exit by spending half of their movement. Every time Moon Dregs moves, the creature moves along with it.

#### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The Moon Dregs makes any two attacks.

***Tentacles.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +4, reach 2 m. *Hit* 5 (1d6 + 2) Bludgeoning damage. On a hit, the target must make a DC X (with X being the summoner's DC) Constitution saving throw or become poisoned.

***Stinger.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +4, reach 2 m. *Hit* 5 (1d6 + 2) Piercing damage + 7 (1d8 + 3) Poison damage. On a hit, the target must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of X (where X is the summoner's DC) or become poisoned.

## Level 3: Stunning Poison (Technique Improvement)
Moon Dregs' debilitating poison now has an additional effect: The target is stunned if it fails by 3 or more.

## Level 6: Power Increase (Technique Improvement)
Your Moon Dregs have evolved, becoming stronger and tougher. Your Moon Dregs gains the following benefits. Its proficiency bonus is now equal to your own. Its hit die becomes a d12. Its poison damage now overcomes resistances, and its poisoned condition overcomes immunities to the condition. It also gains the following two features:

***Overwhelming Strength.*** Moon Dregs can grapple a target it hits with its tentacle attack.

***Poison Stinger.*** A creature makes its Constitution saving throw with disadvantage if the saving throw is caused by Moon Dregs' stinger.

## Level 10: Poisonous Growth (Technique Improvement)
Moon Dregs has grown even stronger, now gaining new bodily functions. Moon Dregs' poison now overcomes immunities, and it gains the following features:

***Stinger Throw.*** Moon Dregs can use its stingers as a ranged attack with a range of 4/20 meters.

***Swallow.*** While Moon Dregs is grappling a creature, it can choose to swallow it. While inside Moon Dregs, the creature is considered restrained. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw at the beginning of its turn. On a failure, it takes 6d10 poison damage and becomes poisoned. On a success, it takes half as much damage and is not poisoned. The creature can attack Moon Dregs from the inside with advantage, and if it deals damage equal to 1/4th of Moon Dregs' maximum hit points, it is spit out within 1 meter of Moon Dregs. This feature is not affected by your Shikigami Empowerment.

## Level 14: Moon Knight (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

All shikigami users share a weakness: they're not proficient in close-quarters combat. As an action, for 10 Cursed Energy, while Moon Dregs is summoned, you can allow it to enter your body and cover you entirely, creating an armor-like form. While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:

Your Strength and Constitution scores are replaced by Moon Dregs' scores, unless your scores are already higher.
You gain its resistances and immunities.
You gain its features.
You gain its flying speed.
You gain its current hit points as temporary hit points.

This armor lasts for 1 minute or until the temporary hit points are depleted. As a bonus action, you can spend Cursed Energy up to your Charisma modifier, regaining temporary hit points equal to 5 times the result.

## Level 20: True Form (Technique Improvement)
Moon Dregs has reached its peak, unlocking a new level of power you never thought it could achieve. Moon Dregs gains the following benefits: It gains resistance to magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Its damaging features gain two additional damage dice.

It also gains the following features:

***Siege Monster.*** Moon Dregs deals twice as much damage to objects and structures.

***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If Moon Dregs fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Additionally, its debilitating poison now has a new effect: The target is paralyzed if it fails by 4 or more.

## Technique Reversal: Sun Dregs
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal`*

You can transform Moon Dregs it into a bright yellow version called Sun Dregs, a more support-focused form. 

While Moon Dregs is summoned, as a bonus action, you transform it into Sun Dregs. While the shikigami is summoned, you can use a bonus action to freely switch between Moon Dregs and Sun Dregs. When Sun Dregs is summoned and you use your Moon Knight feature, you will gain all features, resistances, immunities, flying speed, and temporary hit points from Sun Dregs instead.
