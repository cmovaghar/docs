As a user of the Earthen Insect Trance, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Shikigami Chanting
If you gain the Chanting Cursed feat, you can now combine chanting with your shikigami. 

When chanting while using your shikigami, they receive the following bonuses:
- The fly speed of the shikigami doubles.
- The damage dice of the goop doubles.
- The range of the goop explosion increases to a 3-meter radius.

## Level 1: Earthen Insect Trance (Lapse Technique)
You are able to conjure small flying shikigami that carry large nutshell-like pouches between their legs. 

As a bonus action, you can spend 1 cursed energy to summon up to two of these [Nutshell Shikigami](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Nutshell_Shikigami_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)) within 1 meter of yourself.

These shikigami act on your turn and are controlled by you following the [Summon Commanding Rules](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Variant_Rules_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)#Summon_Commanding_Rules).

They remain active until killed or until you take a short or long rest. The maximum number of Nutshell Shikigami you can have at once is 1 + half your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2, rounded down).

At 11th level, the maximum number of Nutshell Shikigami you can have increases to 1 + your Charisma modifier.

## Level 3: Empowered Shikigami (Technique Improvement)
You can imbue cursed energy into your shikigami to enhance their strength. 

Whenever you summon a Nutshell Shikigami, you may spend up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) in cursed energy. For each cursed energy spent, their Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores increase by an amount equal to the energy spent.

Additionally, their flying speed increases by 3 meters for each point of cursed energy spent.

## Level 6: Goop Improvement (Technique Improvement)
Your Nutshell Shikigami now carries a more potent goop within its nutshell-like pouch. 

When the shikigami is killed, the goop deals 10 (3d6) Acid damage and blinds creatures in the area. The save DC to avoid being affected by the goop is increased by your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

At higher levels, the damage of the goop increases: it becomes 5d6 at 11th level, 8d6 at 17th level, and 12d6 at 20th level.

***Empowered Goop.*** If you spend the maximum amount of cursed energy allowed with Empowered Shikigami, the goop becomes even more potent. The damage die increases by one tier (from d6 to d8), and the DC to avoid the effects of the goop increases by twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2).

## Level 10: Lasting Effect (Technique Improvement)
The goop released by your Shikigami has become even more deadly, capable of not only obstructing vision but also burning the eyes of those affected. 

Whenever a creature fails the Dexterity saving throw, they must also make a Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they suffer from [First Degree Burns](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Burned).

***Empowered Burn.*** If you spend the maximum amount of cursed energy allowed with Empowered Shikigami, the burns become even more severe. On a failed save, the creature instead suffers from [Second Degree Burns](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Burned).

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature: Sack Overflow (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Your technique has always relied on your shikigami dying for it to work, but through the Tokyo teachings, you've learned to speed up this process. 

Whenever a creature enters the range of a Nutshell Shikigami, or the Nutshell Shikigami enters the reach of a creature, you can spend 4 cursed energy to make their sacks explode (no action required), killing them instantly and causing the usual effects. When triggered in this way, the explosionâ€™s range increases to 10 feet.

***Empowered Overflow.*** If you spend the maximum amount of cursed energy with Empowered Shikigami, the forced explosion gains additional effects. The Dexterity saving throw becomes a Constitution saving throw, and the damage is doubled.

## Level 20: Natural Empowerment (Technique Improvement)
You have been empowering your shikigami for so long that it has become second nature. 

Whenever you summon a Nutshell Shikigami, it automatically counts as if you have spent the maximum amount of cursed energy for Empowered Shikigami.

## Technique Reversal: Insect Assimilation
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

After mastering Reverse Cursed Technique, you have now unlocked your cursed technique reversal. 

While you normally summon your shikigami, you can now channel their powers through yourself as a medium. To activate this reversal, you must spend 2 cursed energy as a bonus action.

Upon activation, a large nut-like sack forms beneath you, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your Shikigami's hit die. Once these temporary hit points are reduced to 0, all creatures (except yourself) within 3 meters of you must make the saving throw as if they were affected by your Nutshell Shikigami's blinding goop feature.

The DC for this effect is now your cursed energy DC.
