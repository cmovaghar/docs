As a user of the Explosive Flesh, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Aptitude for Healing
Due to the dangerous nature of your technique, you have learned to cope with its challenges more effectively. 

When gaining the Reverse Cursed Technique cursed feat, you may ignore 1 prerequisite.

Level 1: Explosive Flesh (Lapse Technique)
Your innate technique allows you to turn any part of your body into a deadly bomb. 

By spending cursed energy, you can quickly remove and throw a body part at a specified point. The removal of the body part is done through one of the actions described below, while throwing it requires an action:

|Body Part|Cost|Action Cost|Effect|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tiny Part(Tooth, Fingers).|1 Cursed Energy and lose a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).|Free Action|You can throw the removed body part to any point within 40 meters. All creatures within a 1-meter radius of the impact must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take Xd6 force damage and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and are not knocked prone.|
|Small Part(Eyes, Ears, Nose).|2 Cursed Energy and lose a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier times half your Jujutsu Sorcerer level (minimum of 2 hit point).|Bonus Action|You can throw the removed small body part to a point of your choice within 35 meters. All creatures within a 3-meter radius of the impact must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take Xd8 force damage and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and are not knocked prone.|
|Medium Part(Hands, Feet).|4 Cursed Energy and lose a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier times your Jujutsu Sorcerer level (minimum of 2 hit point).|Action|You can throw the removed medium body part to a point of your choice within 23 meters. All creatures within a 5-meter radius of the impact must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take Xd10 force damage and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and are not knocked prone.|
|Large Part(Arms, Legs).|6 Cursed Energy and lose a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier times your Jujutsu Sorcerer level (minimum of 2 hit point).|Full Turn|You can throw the removed medium body part to a point of your choice within 20 meters. All creatures within a 6-meter radius of the impact must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take Xd12 force damage and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and are not knocked prone.|

After using a limb in an explosion, it is considered removed. The value of X in your damage calculations is equal to your Charisma modifier. Additionally, attacks from this technique deal twice as much damage to objects and structures.

***Faster Throws.*** At 5th level, you have gained greater mastery over your technique, allowing you to throw your limbs more quickly. You can now throw them as either an action or a bonus action.

***Stronger Explosions.*** At 11th level, through extensive use of your technique, your explosions have become deadlier. When a creature fails the saving throw against your explosions, they are deafened for 1 minute. They may attempt a Constitution saving throw at the beginning of their turns, ending the condition early on a success. Additionally, your explosions now deal three times as much damage to objects and structures, and their explosion radius increases by 1 meter.

At 14th level, creatures that fail the saving throw are also blinded.

## Level 3: Reduced Self-Harm (Technique Improvement)
You have learned to minimize the damage you take when using your technique. 

The hit point loss from using any part of your body as an explosive is reduced by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

At 5th level, this reduction increases to an amount equal to twice your Constitution modifier plus your Jujutsu Sorcerer level (minimum of 1 hit point).

## Level 6: Reactive Explosions (Technique Improvement)
Your mastery of explosions has allowed you to detonate them instantly. 

You can now trigger an explosion from one of your limbs at the same cost as usual, but instead of throwing it, you may detonate it as a reaction when you are hit by or hit with a melee attack. The explosion occurs directly on your body, affecting all nearby creatures.

Creatures must make the Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage unless their passive Perception is higher than your Cursed Energy DC.

## Level 10: Another One Bites the Dust (Extension Technique)
Your explosive prowess has reached new heights, allowing you to trigger massive delayed blasts from your removed body parts. 

As an action, you can spend cursed energy equal to the cost of the body part in your Lapse Technique to set up a delayed explosion.

Choose a removed body part within 10 meters of you. At the end of your next turn, it detonates, forcing all creatures within a 6-meter radius to make a Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, they take Xd12 force damage and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not knocked prone.

You can spend additional cursed energy, up to your proficiency bonus, to increase the damage by an additional Xd12 for each cursed energy spent. The value of X is equal to your Charisma modifier.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Elemental Explosions (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned to create different types of explosions, each with its own unique effect. 

By spending additional cursed energy equal to the energy spent to use the bomb, you can transform it into an elemental bomb. The elemental bomb deals extra damage of fire, cold, or lightning type, with the additional damage equal to the original bomb's damage dice.

## Level 20: Terrorist (Technique Improvement)
Your fame has spread throughout the sorcerer world, and your explosions have become a national threat. 

The damage of your explosions is now increased to twice your Charisma modifier plus your proficiency bonus. 

Additionally, your explosions now ignore features such as Evasion, and their explosion radius is increased by 1 meter.

Furthermore, your explosions now deal four times as much damage to objects and structures.

## Technique Reversal: Living Bomb
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

After mastering Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked the ability to reverse cursed techniques on others. You can now turn the body parts of creatures you touch into bombs. 

Once per turn, for X cursed energy, when you make a melee weapon attack, you can attempt to blow up a creature's body part.

On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you can choose a body part to explode, causing damage and effects as per your original abilities. On a successful save, nothing happens. 

The cursed energy cost for this feature is equal to the Explosive Featureâ€™s cost for the targeted body part, doubled. Additionally, the damage dice for Explosive Flesh are also doubled when using this technique. The creature suffers the effects of Explosive Flesh as usual.

The targeted body part cannot be the skull, neck, or torso.
