As a user of the Star Dictator, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Star Dictator (Lapse Technique)
You are able to use your domain, but your domain is unlike any other. Instead of being surrounded by a typical barrier, the boundary of your domain is formed by the paths of your shikigami. You gain a [Small Pteranodon Shikigami](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Small_Pteranodon_Shikigami_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)) that can be summoned from your hair. You can summon multiple of these shikigami, and they will fly in an orbiting pattern to create the domain.

As an action, you can summon up to 4 of these shikigami, each costing 2 cursed energy. While the shikigami are active, you can control them as a bonus action. You can also use this bonus action to forgo their action, having them create your domain instead. The damage and range of your domain depend on how many shikigami are active, with the center of the domain being any point within 10 meters of yourself.

- With 1 shikigami, the damage is 3d6 slashing in a 5-meter radius.
- With 2 shikigami, the damage is 6d6 slashing in a 10-meter radius.
- With 3 shikigami, the damage is 9d6 slashing in a 15-meter radius.
- With 4 shikigami, the damage is 12d6 slashing in a 20-meter radius.

This damage is considered a sure-hit effect, as it is part of your domain. The damage is dealt at the end of each of your turns. Additionally, you can adjust the radius of your domain by clustering all the shikigami into a smaller area. For example, 4 shikigami can deal 12d6 damage, but only within a 5-meter radius. The shikigami end their turns at evenly spaced points throughout the radius of the domain.

## Level 3: Mole Rat Shikigami (Technique Improvement)
You have unlocked a new type of shikigami, the [Mole Rat Shikigami](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Mole_Rat_Shikigami_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)). 

This shikigami works similarly to the others, able to create your domain, but with a few key differences. You may only have one Mole Rat Shikigami active at a time. This shikigami creates your domain once it has completed a loop using its movement speed. You can control the Mole Rat Shikigami to walk around, and once it returns to its starting point, your domain will be created.

Once the domain is established in this way, your Small Pteranodon Shikigami no longer need to follow a specific path to create the sure-hit slashes. They are free to move and attack at your command, and the slashes will still be created, dealing damage based on how many shikigami are active.

As an action, you can summon the Mole Rat Shikigami for 8 cursed energy. You can control both it and the Pteranodon shikigami with a bonus action.

## Level 6: Efficient Summoning (Technique Improvement)
You have mastered the art of summoning your shikigami. Now, when you summon the Small Pteranodon Shikigami, you can summon up to 6 of them, with each still costing the same amount of cursed energy.

With 5 or 6 shikigami active, the damage and range of your domain increase as follows:

- With 5 shikigami active, the damage is 15d6 slashing in a 25-meter radius.
- With 6 shikigami active, the damage is 18d6 slashing in a 30-meter radius.

## Level 10: Improved Shikigami (Technique Improvement)
You have greatly improved both of your shikigami, now able to summon stronger versions in place of the previous ones. You can now replace the Small Pteranodon Shikigami with the [Pteranodon Shikigami](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Pteranodon_Shikigami_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)) and the Mole Rat Shikigami with the [Large Mole Rat Shikigami](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Large_Mole_Rat_Shikigami_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)).

As an action, you can summon the Large Mole Rat Shikigami for 12 cursed energy. Additionally, as an action, you can summon up to 6 Pteranodon Shikigami, each costing 4 cursed energy.

The Large Mole Rat Shikigami functions the same as the previous version, but the new Pteranodon Shikigami has increased damage. The damage and range for the Pteranodon Shikigami are as follows:

- With 1 shikigami, the damage is 3d8 slashing in a 5-meter radius.
- With 2 shikigami, the damage is 6d8 slashing in a 10-meter radius.
- With 3 shikigami, the damage is 9d8 slashing in a 15-meter radius.
- With 4 shikigami, the damage is 12d8 slashing in a 20-meter radius.
- With 5 shikigami, the damage is 15d8 slashing in a 25-meter radius.
- With 6 shikigami, the damage is 18d8 slashing in a 30-meter radius.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Pteranodon Punishment (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have discovered a new method of utilizing your shikigami. 

Instead of summoning them for your domain, you can now sacrifice them to launch an attack. As an action, you can spend 15 cursed energy to release a swarm of your shikigami in a 15-meter cone. Creatures within the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 25d10 slashing damage as several of your Pteranodon shikigami collide with them. On a successful save, they take half as much damage.

## Level 20: Mastered Domain (Technique Improvement)
You have mastered this unique domain technique. 

You can now maintain two large mole rat shikigami and up to eight Pteranodons simultaneously. 

Additionally, the Pteranodons have increased damage and range. For each shikigami, the damage and range scale as follows: 
|Number of Pteranodons|Damage|Range|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|3d10|10-meter radius|
|2|6d10|20-meter radius|
|3|9d10|30-meter radius|
|4|12d10|40-meter radius|
|5|15d10|50-meter radius|
|6|18d10|60-meter radius|
|7|22d10|70-meter radius|
|8|25d10|80-meter radius|

## Technique Reversal: Star Guardian
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have mastered Reverse Cursed Technique, unlocking the ability to reverse your cursed technique. 

As part of summoning any of your shikigami, you can choose to double the cursed energy cost to grant them a new effect. 

The range and action cost for controlling these shikigami remain the same as with their normal form. However, these reversed shikigami can now heal within their radius. They heal for the same amount of hit points as they would deal in damage.
