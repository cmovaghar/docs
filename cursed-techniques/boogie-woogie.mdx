As a user of the Boogie Woogie, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Boogie Woogie (Lapse Technique)
You have created a unique technique that allows you to switch places with your opponents, simple but highly effective. By clapping, you can switch places with an ally or an object within 10 meters of you that has Cursed Energy, costing 1 Cursed Energy. You can use this technique as an action, bonus action, or reaction. Additionally, you gain extra reactions equal to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus, which can only be used for this feature.

Moreover, you can now imbue cursed energy into anyone or anything simply by touching them, making them altered by cursed energy.

For an object to count as a cursed object, it must have been altered by a cursed tool’s feature or imbued with cursed energy. A person with cursed energy is anyone who does not have levels in the Heavenly Restriction class or is holding a Cursed Tool.

If this feature targets a New Shadow Style: Simple Domain, the entire Simple Domain is swapped, including all creatures and objects inside. If the swap would place a creature or object in an occupied space or one too small for it, that creature or object is instead swapped to the nearest unoccupied space. A creature under the effects of Domain Amplification will still be swapped.

<Note>
	For the purposes of all Boogie Woogie abilities, if a creature is targeted by an attack and someone else is swapped with them as a reaction to that attack, the new creature swapped into the target’s position becomes the new target of the attack. 
	
	Depending on the nature of the attack, this could even result in a creature being hit by their own ranged attack through this swap.
</Note>

## Level 3: Cursed Displacement (Technique Improvement)
Through constant training and practice, you have improved your technique. You can now switch the positions of hostile creatures and use this technique on up to two creatures at once. If a swapped creature was the original target of an attack, the attacker may choose to redirect their attack to another valid target within range. However, they only have knowledge of the positions of objects and creatures before the swap, not after. If a swapped creature or object now occupies the attack's new space, they become the new target.

Whenever you clap (once per round, per creature, no action required), even if you do not use your technique, the affected creature must adjust their attack mid-action if their intended target was swapped. If they were targeting you directly and you clapped, they must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your Cursed Energy DC to successfully re-aim at their new target. If they fail, they strike at their original target's prior location. Clapping without using your technique does not force a saving throw on creatures tracking your cursed energy via the Cursed Energy Tracker feat.

When using this technique, you must log what was swapped and where with the DM (or other players, if applicable) before the attacker declares their adjusted attack. Both choices are revealed simultaneously, and the action is resolved accordingly. This technique cannot cause a creature to hit itself with a melee attack, nor can it extend a melee attack beyond its reach.

## Level 6: Clapping Like Your Life Depends On It (Technique Improvement)
You have further refined your cursed technique, enhancing the efficiency of Boogie Woogie. It now gains the following benefits:

- The range of the technique increases to 15 meters.
- You can use it once per turn as a free action.

## Level 10: Clapping With Your Soul (Technique Improvement)
You have honed your skills, transforming a simple clapping technique into something far greater. Your Boogie Woogie technique now gains the following benefits:

- The range of this technique extends to 20 meters.
- When you switch places with an ally who was previously within range of an enemy right before the swap, your next attack roll has advantage. The same applies to the ally if you were within range before switching, or both of you if you were both in range. Additionally, if you switch places with an enemy while in range of an ally, you gain advantage on your next attack if you are now adjacent to an enemy, and your ally gains advantage against the swapped enemy on their next attack.
- Each time this technique is used on a hostile creature, the DC to resist its effects does not decrease.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Total Sync (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Through your training with allies in Tokyo, you have mastered the ability to synchronize completely with one of them. At the end of a long rest, choose one ally to be in sync with. Whenever you switch places with this ally, they can use their reaction to make an attack roll.

At 20th level, the synced ally can use their reaction to take the Attack action instead of just making a single attack after a switch.

## Level 20: Round of Applause (Technique Improvement)
You have unlocked the ability to give applause from the heart, allowing you to activate your technique by clapping hands with another creature within reach. Additionally, the DC to resist your technique increases by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier.

***Grand Clap.*** Your mastery of battlefield positioning and quick thinking has reached its peak, enabling you to switch all. By performing a Grand Clap for 5 Cursed Energy, you can affect all creatures within 20 meters, swapping the positions of any enemies that fail the saving throw, as well as allies and cursed objects, simultaneously.

## Technique Reversal: Cursed Inaction
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

With your mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique, you have discovered the reversal of your technique. Instead of switching targets, you momentarily immobilize them. Though simple, it is highly effective.

For 2 Cursed Energy, you can immobilize yourself and up to two other creatures (hostile or not), cursed objects, or cursed tools within 20 meters of you. All chosen targets, including yourself, are stunned until the beginning of your next turn. You may activate this technique as an action, bonus action, or reaction, but it does not benefit from the additional reactions granted by the Boogie Woogie feature.

After the first use of this technique, any affected creatures may make a Charisma saving throw against your Cursed Energy DC to resist being immobilized.
