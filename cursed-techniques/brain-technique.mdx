As a user of the Brain Technique, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Active Use Technique
The Brain technique is always active, allowing you to control and use the body you have taken. If your cursed technique ever becomes burnt out or unusable, you will fall prone and become paralyzed.

If you possess the Barrier Master feat, you may attempt to circumvent this by deploying a complex barrier technique, separating the technique's operations. At the start of your turn while your cursed technique is not usable, you must make a DC 30 Intelligence saving throw. On a success, you will not become prone and paralyzed and will be able to operate your body freely. On a failure, you will still become prone and paralyzed. All other rules of technique burnout will still apply.

At 11th level, the DC decreases to 25, and at 17th level, the DC is reduced to 20.

A creature with 21 or more levels in the Barrier Master Sorcerer path automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

### Domain Stealing

If you possess the Domain Expansion feat and steal a body that possesses a domain expansion, when you expand a domain, you must expand the exact domain of the body you have stolen. When expanding the domain in this way, you may use your refinement or the original user's refinement, whichever is higher. If the original user's refinement is higher than yours, you may not alter or change the properties of the domain expansion in any way, unless the body had altered those same properties before.

## Level 1: Body Steal (Lapse Technique)
You possess a rather disturbing technique, one that is frowned upon by most sorcerers. When you have the corpse of a humanoid creature, you can spend 4 cursed energy to perform a ritual, assisted by another creature, to transfer your brain into that creature's body over the course of 5 minutes. This can also be done during a short or long rest, reducing the cursed energy cost to 2 instead. However, this cursed energy cannot be recovered until your next long rest. While inhabiting the creature’s body, you lose any racial features, body feats, and feats related to your previous form. Instead, you gain the following benefits from the new body:

You will acquire the class and subclass features of the body. However, you cannot gain features you already have. You will count as the level the body has in those classes and subclasses, but cannot exceed the body’s level. For example, if the body has 4 levels in the Taijutsu Master sorcerer path, you cannot count as higher than 4th level in that subclass.

If a class or subclass feature grants something outside the class features, such as a feat or ability score increase, you will not gain the benefit if it has already been applied to the body. Instead, you will retain what has been applied.

The creature’s race becomes your race, and you will gain its racial features, unless they have already been applied to the body, such as ability score increases or proficiencies.

Your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become those of the current body. While your hit dice remain unchanged, your maximum hit points will be recalculated based on the Constitution score and body feats of the new form.

You will gain the feats the body possesses, though you cannot gain the Jujutsu Genius or Black Flash feats. As usual, you cannot gain the same feat more than once unless otherwise specified.

If the body has a feat or feature that increases cursed energy, you will not gain that feat. Instead, it will contribute to the body’s maximum cursed energy, which you can now use alongside your own. You can fully mask your cursed energy with the energy of the body. When someone attempts to sense or trace your cursed energy, they will perceive the cursed energy of the body. A creature with no levels in the Jujutsu Sorcerer class will have cursed energy equal to their Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

When you inhabit the body, it will appear exactly the same, except for a scar on its forehead, indicating that your brain is inside. The scar cannot be healed by any means due to a binding vow that activates with the technique, though it will heal naturally over time. You can pull back the top of your head to reveal your brain, which is a normal brain with a human mouth. Creatures will find it difficult to recognize you, as you have fully taken on the body. They can attempt an insight check against your cursed energy DC, but with disadvantage, to determine if you are an impostor. Those familiar with the body may make the check without disadvantage.

When you switch bodies again, you lose all features and abilities gained from the previous body, including cursed energy, feats, class features, and racial features. Additionally, your age will always reflect that of the new body, making you effectively immortal. You cannot possess the body of a Heavenly Restriction user. If you take the body of a Cursed Vessel, you will adopt the race they have possessed for the purposes of racial features. Aside from the Brain technique, you may not possess more than three different innate techniques.

Finally, in times of distress, if the host body has a deep connection to a person or situation, the body may resist you. The lingering remnants of its soul could cause the body to act against you, such as attacking or choking you. This is rare, but can occur under the right circumstances.

## Level 3: Memory Retention (Technique Improvement)
You have discovered a rare phenomenon that occurs when you take a new host: the memories of the body flow into your brain, granting you all the memories the body possessed. You now have advantage on Deception checks to mimic the body. Additionally, you gain all proficiencies and languages the body possesses.

Whenever you switch bodies, you retain any information you acquired from the body's memories. You will keep the languages that the body knew, provided you have used them enough to learn them yourself (as determined by your DM). However, you will lose all proficiencies and other traits gained from the body when you switch.

## Level 6: Technique Maximizer (Technique Improvement)
You have realized that you can exceed the potential of the body through your own expertise. You will now always count as your level for Innate Techniques, regardless of the body's level. Your DM may also determine that you can count as your level for other class or subclass features, depending on their relation to the user (e.g., Sorcerous Origins).

Developing skills taken from others can be challenging, but not impossible. Your DM may use the slow and steady rule to determine your progression of class and subclass features beyond the original level of the body they were gained from.

It is also possible for a creature without levels in the Jujutsu Sorcerer Class to possess an innate technique. When you take the body of a non-sorcerer, you may gain their Innate Technique.

## Level 10: Multi-Faceted Growth (Technique Improvement)
You are now able to gain an unnatural depth of understanding in subjects your bodies were knowledgeable about, drawing from multiple lifetimes of experience. When you gain proficiency in a skill from a body that you also possess, you will gain expertise in that skill. This benefit lasts as long as you retain the features and proficiencies from the body.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Cap Spin Trick (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have realized that the cap covering your brain is not a hindrance, but a tool. As a reaction to an attack targeting you, you can spin the cap off your head, adding your Charisma modifier to your AC for that attack. As part of the same reaction, you can reconnect the cap to your head. This cannot be used against an attack targeting any part of the body that isn't the head.

If you are using the Limb System, this ability can only be used against an attack targeting your head.

## Level 20: Just Another Body (Technique Improvement)
You have lost your identity, now only a brain seeking a new host to continue living through the ages. Life and death have lost all meaning to you.

Your ability to assume new identities is unmatched, and your technique is such a perfect imitation that not even the Six Eyes can identify you as an impostor. 
 
Truesight cannot reveal you as an imposter either. If a creature uses any method other than their intuition to identify you, they will only perceive the exact features of the body you are inhabiting.

## Technique Reversal: Neural Reverberation
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Through your mastery of Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked your cursed technique reversal, which is as unique as your innate technique. Normally, you control your own brain, but with your reversal, you can disrupt the brains of others. 

As an action, for 10 cursed energy, you can touch the head of a creature within range, causing their brain function to be disrupted. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 8d8 psychic damage and have their neural network disrupted for 1 minute. On a successful save, they are not disrupted.

While disrupted, if the creature wishes to use an innate technique feature, they must make another Constitution saving throw before it can be used successfully. 

If they fail, their technique fails to activate, and the cursed energy is wasted in a useless form. 

If they succeed, the technique functions as normal. At the end of their turn, the affected creature can repeat the initial saving throw, ending the disruption on a success.
