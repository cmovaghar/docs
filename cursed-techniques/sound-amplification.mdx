As a user of Sound Amplification, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Sound Amplification (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to transform yourself into a sound amplification device. You gain proficiency in the Performance skill or expertise if you are already proficient. Additionally, you gain proficiency with one instrument of your choice and start with that instrument as part of your starting equipment.

As an action, by expending 2 cursed energy while holding your electrical instrument, you can make a ranged cursed energy attack roll against one creature within 10 meters. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 thunder damage and is pushed back 3 meters.

The damage for this technique increases to 3d10 at 5th level, 5d10 at 11th level, 8d10 at 17th level, and 12d10 at 20th level.

***Sound Waves.*** At 5th level, you become more adept at manipulating your cursed energy waves, allowing you to launch multiple at once. When you use your action to unleash sound waves, you can make additional ranged cursed energy attack rolls equal to the number of attacks you can make as part of your Attack action, with each attack costing 2 cursed energy.

***Sound Blast.*** At 11th level, you have learned to concentrate your sound waves into a powerful blast. As an action, by expending 6 cursed energy, you can unleash a massive sound wave from your instrument, forcing every creature within a 5-meter cone to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take 9d10 thunder damage, are pushed back 6 meters, and are deafened until the start of your next turn. On a success, they take half as much damage, are pushed back only 3 meters, and are not deafened. This technique deals double damage to objects and structures. The damage for this technique increases to 13d10 at 17th level and 17d10 at 20th level.

## Level 3: Resonance (Technique Improvement)
You've learned that playing alone isn't enough—you need to know when to unleash your biggest hit. Whenever you take the action to use Sound Amplification or Sound Blast, you can choose to start playing your instrument without immediately launching the attack. You can maintain this performance for a number of rounds up to your Charisma modifier, after which you are forced to release the attack.

For each round you continue playing, you add two additional damage dice to the attack, and the thunder damage ignores resistances when used this way. While playing, you are considered to be concentrating. You cannot use Sound Amplification’s additional attacks while channeling it in this manner.

Additionally, if you were already playing before launching the attack, you may release it as a reaction instead of an action.

## Level 10: Epic Solo (Extension Technique)
You can unleash a powerful solo that enhances the effects of your sound techniques. As an action, by expending 6 cursed energy, you perform an electrifying solo that lasts for 1 minute. During this time, whenever you use Sound Amplification features, you may add an additional 2d10 thunder damage to the attack’s total damage. You can also spend additional cursed energy equal to your Charisma modifier to increase the damage by 2d10 per energy spent.

Additionally, your performance creates a shockwave of sound. All creatures within a 5-meter radius must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they are pushed back 5 meters and are deafened until the end of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage from the solo and are not pushed back.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Musical Vibes (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You've learned to relax and embrace the music. As a bonus action, by expending 8 cursed energy, you can start playing your instrument and set a vibe of your choice for 1 minute. You can have only one of the following vibes active at a time:

***Happy Vibes.*** Your music creates happy, upbeat vibes that everyone loves! Whenever you hit a creature with your Sound Amplification, they must make a Charisma saving throw or become charmed until your "vibe" ends. They can remake the saving throw at the start of their turns, ending the condition early on a success.

***Sad Vibes.*** Your music gives off sad, depressing vibes that bring the mood down. Whenever you hit a creature with your Sound Amplification, they must make a Charisma saving throw or be knocked prone and have their speed reduced to 0 until your "vibe" ends. They can remake the saving throw at the start of your turns, with their movement speed returning to normal on a success.

***Angry Vibes.*** Your music radiates angry, rebellious vibes that make people lash out! Whenever you hit a creature with your Sound Amplification, they must make a Charisma saving throw or become berserk until your "vibe" ends. They can remake the saving throw at the start of their turns, ending the condition early on a success. While this vibe is active, you are considered to be concentrating, as if you were concentrating on a spell.

## Level 20: Master of Sound (Technique Improvement)
Your mastery of sound allows you to exert complete control over its effects. Your sound techniques now have the following benefits:

- Your attacks using Sound Amplification features ignore resistance to thunder damage, and your technique also bypasses immunity to the deafened condition.
- Creatures hit by your sound techniques must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they are knocked prone and deafened until the end of their next turn. On a success, they are unaffected. The saving throw is made with disadvantage.
- You gain immunity to the deafened condition and cannot be affected by sound-based effects that would normally incapacitate or harm you.

## Technique Reversal: Sound Nullification
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have mastered both the Reverse Cursed Technique and the art of music, unlocking your cursed technique reversal. As an action, by expending 4 cursed energy, you can reduce the sound in a 10-meter radius around yourself. Any creature entirely within this radius is deafened and cannot use innate technique features. You must concentrate on this effect as if concentrating on a spell, and it lasts for 1 minute.
