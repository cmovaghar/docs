As a user of the Drill Hair, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Drill Hair (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to use Cursed Energy to transform your hair into small drills, which you can then fire off. 

When you take the Attack action, you can spend 1 Cursed Energy to replace one attack with a ranged Cursed Energy attack roll that has a range of 10 meters. This attack deals 1d6 + your Charisma modifier in piercing damage.

At 5th level, this techniqueâ€™s range and damage increase to 15 meters and 2d6 + Charisma modifier. At 11th level, it increases to 20 meters 3d6 + Charisma modifier. At 17th level, the range becomes 25 meters and the damage increases to 4d6 + Charisma modifier. Finally, at 20th level, the range extends to 30 meters and the damage becomes 5d6 + Charisma modifier.

## Level 3: Explosive Drill (Technique Improvement)
You have learned how to make your drills explode upon impact. 

When attacking with a drill, you may spend an additional 3 Cursed Energy. This causes the drill to explode in a 1-meter radius at the point of impact, dealing an additional 3d6 fire damage to creatures in that radius.

At 5th level, the explosion damage increases to 5d6. At 11th level, it increases to 7d6. At 17th level, the damage rises to 9d6, and at 20th level, it reaches 11d6.

## Level 6: Charged Drill (Technique Improvement)
You have now learned how to add more power to your drills before releasing them. 

You may replace multiple attacks as part of the Attack action when you use your drill. For each attack you replace in this way, you can spend an additional 1 Cursed Energy, and the damage of your drill is multiplied by the number of attacks replaced.

## Level 10: Maximum Drill (Extension Technique)
You have learned a new way to use your drills. You can now channel more of your Cursed Energy into one massive drill. 

As an action, by spending 8 Cursed Energy, you can fire this new drill in a 5-meter wide, 30-meter long line. Anyone in this line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 8d10 piercing damage. On a success, they take half the damage. This technique deals quadruple damage to objects and structures and ignores cover.

At 11th level, the damage increases to 11d10. At 17th level, it increases to 14d10, and at 20th level, it reaches 17d10.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Hand Drill (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned a new way to use your drill from your time at the Tokyo school. You are now able to create a drill from your hair that can be used as a melee weapon. 

As a bonus action, by spending 4 Cursed Energy, you can summon this drill. While holding the drill, you can use it as a normal melee weapon with a range of 5 feet, dealing 4d8 + your Charisma modifier in piercing damage. This weapon lasts for 1 minute or until dismissed.

## Level 20: Stronger Drills (Technique Improvement)
Your drills have reached their maximum potential. 

The piercing damage they deal now ignores resistances. 

Additionally, you have advantage on attack rolls when using your drills.

## Technique Reversal: Unscrew
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Due to your mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique, you have learned your Cursed Technique reversal. You are now able to unscrew the drills you have shot. 

As part of any non-explosive drill feature, you can spend its cost an additional time to have the drill return through the target, dealing the appropriate damage again. 

For example, if you use a drill hair attack, you can spend an additional 1 Cursed Energy to have it return through the target, dealing another 1d6 + your Charisma modifier in piercing damage.
