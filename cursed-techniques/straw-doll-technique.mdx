As a user of the Straw Doll Technique, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Nail Projectiles (Lapse Technique)
You start with 1 Hammer, 24 Nails, and 1 Straw Doll. When making an Unarmed Strike, you may spend 1 Cursed Energy to instead hold a nail with cursed energy and strike it with your hammer, making a Ranged Cursed Energy Attack Roll (10/36 meters range). Alternatively, if you are within 1 meter of the target, you may make a *Melee Cursed Energy Attack Roll*. This attack deals 1d6 + your Charisma modifier Piercing damage, and the nail becomes stuck in the target. Whether you hit or miss, the nail is spent.

As a bonus action, while touching a creature that has taken damage from Nail Projectiles you can make a Charisma check (DC 10) to regain the nail. A creature may use an action to make a Strength check against your Cursed Energy DC to remove a nail from their body.

This technique's damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 11th level, 7d6 at 17th level and 11d6 at 20th level. 

Additionally, if you have the *Cursed Projectiles* feat, your Hammer is treated as the imbued weapon for the feat and your Nails gain the properties of Cursed Projectiles.

***Tracking Nails.*** At 5th level, your nails remain imbued with your cursed energy, making them easy for you to detect. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to locate creatures that have one of your nails pierced into them. Additionally, they cannot hide from you, as your cursed energy resonates from the embedded nail.

## Level 3: Resonance (Extension Technique)
You have mastered the art of using your straw doll to harm your enemies. You gain proficiency in Sleight of Hand, or expertise if you are already proficient.

As a reaction, when a creature within your reach takes slashing or piercing damage, you can make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against its AC, with an additional modifier based on the body part’s resonance strength (+3 for weak, +6 for fine, +9 for strong). On a success, you extract a part of the creature corresponding to the highest resonance strength you qualify for and incorporate it into your straw doll.

Once the part is mixed in, you can spend 3 Cursed Energy to activate Resonance, allowing you to target the straw doll for a special attack. As an action, you can drive a nail through the body part using a hammer. This attack always hits. When you damage the doll, the target takes necrotic damage based on the incorporated body part, as detailed in the table below. This damage bypasses resistances and immunities and is considered Major Soul Harming.

The strength and effect of Resonance depend on the body part used. Stronger effects inherit the special effects of weaker ones, maintaining the duration of the stronger effect.

| Resonance Strength | Part Used | Effect | Damage |
|-|-|-|-|
| Weak | Hair, skin blood. | Target gains disadvantage on attack rolls untill the end of their next turn. | Your proficiency bonus in D8s |
| Fine | Small parts such as fingers, small amounts of flesh. | The target cannot use reactions until the end of their next turn. | Your Charisma modifier plus your proficiency bonus in D8s |
| Strong | Limbs like arms, legs, or vital organs. | The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or be stunned for 1 minute as black spikes erupt from its body. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turn to end the effect. | Twice your Charisma modifier plus your proficiency bonus in D10s. |

## Level 6: Hairpin (Extension Technique)
You have developed a new way to harm your enemies.

As a bonus action or reaction, you can spend 4 Cursed Energy to detonate one or more of your nails currently embedded in a surface, object, or creature, causing a massive Cursed Energy explosion. Every creature within a 2-meter radius of the exploding nail must make a Dexterity saving throw. 

On a failure, they take 5d8 necrotic damage and are knocked prone. 

On a success, they take half damage and remain standing. You can detonate a number of nails simultaneously up to your proficiency bonus.

Alternatively, you can focus the explosion on a single creature impaled by a nail. In this case, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, suffering the full effects on a failure.

The damage of this technique increases as you gain levels: 8d8 at level 11, 12d8 at level 17, and 17d8 at level 20.

## Level 10: Internal Hairpin (Extension Technique)
You have mastered a new application of your Hairpin technique.

While a creature has a nail embedded in its body, you can use a bonus action or reaction to spend 8 Cursed Energy and activate Hairpin, causing the nail to rotate at incredible speeds to inflict severe damage. 

The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 8d10 necrotic damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and is not stunned.

Additionally, if the target fails the saving throw and the nail is embedded in a limb (excluding the head, neck, or torso), the limb’s damage state decreases by 1. If you are not using the limb system variant rule, the limb instead becomes severely injured.

The damage of this technique increases as you gain levels: 12d10 at 17th level, and 17d10 at 20th level.

## Level 11: Improved Resonance (Extension Technique)
You have uncovered a new way to harness Resonance. Instead of using a straw doll, you can directly target the creature’s own body, greatly amplifying its effectiveness.

As an action, you can spend 6 Cursed Energy to make an attack roll against a creature that is incapacitated, restrained, stunned, petrified, or paralyzed. On a hit, the creature is knocked prone and struck by Resonance, with its own body serving as the conduit instead of the straw doll, gaining the following properties.

| Resonance Strength | Part Used | Effect | Damage |
|-|-|-|-|
| Very Strong | Creature's body |  For 1 minute, whenever the creature attempts to use a feature that costs Cursed Energy, it must make a Charisma saving throw with disadvantage. On a success, the feature activates as normal. On a failure, the feature fails to activate, but the creature still loses the Cursed Energy it would have spent. The creature may repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, still with disadvantage, ending the effect on a success. | Twice your Charisma modifier plus your proficiency bonus in D12s. |

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Nail Bed (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned to create a bed of nails, immobilizing your opponents.

While a creature has at least five nails embedded in its body, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to force it to make a Constitution saving throw. 

On a failure, it takes 10d12 necrotic damage + 10d12 piercing damage and becomes restrained for 1 minute. 

On a success, it takes half damage and is not restrained. The creature can attempt a Strength check against your Cursed Energy DC at the start of its turns, ending the restrained condition on a success.

You cannot use Nail Bed on a creature already restrained by this technique.

This technique's damage increases as you gain levels: 13d12 + 13d12 at 17th level, and 17d12 + 17d12 at 20th level.

## Level 20: Destructive Resonance (Improved Technique)
Your resonance has grown so powerful that the souls of your targets can no longer withstand its force.

All damage dealt by your resonance is doubled.

Additionally, once per turn, when you deal damage with your resonance, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they gain one level of exhaustion.

## Technique Reversal: Cursed Doll Transformation
You have mastered the Reversed Cursed Technique, allowing you to merge with your target's body and your straw doll, becoming a living amalgamation of flesh, bone, and straw powered by both positive and negative cursed energy.

As a reaction, by spending 8 Cursed Energy whenever you use the Resonance feature, you merge with the chosen part of the creature and your straw doll. When you take damage from an attack or damaging effect, the creature you targeted with this feature takes a quarter of the damage you received (rounded up), which ignores any resistances or immunities it has.

Additionally, whenever you must make a saving throw, the creature affected by this feature must also make the same saving throw, suffering the consequences of any failed or successful saves. If they would take damage from the saving throw, it is still a quarter of the damage roll (rounded down).

You are treated as a straw doll and an inanimate object for the purposes of Cursed Straw features and effects. All damage you receive from a Cursed Straw feature is reduced to a quarter of its original damage (rounded down). You ignore any effects your Cursed Straw features would inflict on yourself when performing them. You do not take extra damage if you score a *Black Flash* from a self-inflicted attack.

The Cursed Doll Transformation lasts until the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, you die, or you use the Cursed Doll Transformation on another target.
