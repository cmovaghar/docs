As a user of the Heart Catch, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Heart Catch (Lapse Technique)
You can create a floating virtual hand that hovers near you. 

As an action, you may spend up to half your Charisma modifier in Cursed Energy to create this hand, which lasts for 1 minute or until dismissed. The hand is Small in size.

The hand can pick up and manipulate Small or smaller objects or creatures. As a bonus action, you can control the hand to manipulate objects, open unlocked doors or containers, grab items, or attack with a wielded weapon. When attacking, make a melee Cursed Energy attack roll against the target's AC, dealing the weapon’s damage on a hit.

The hand has an AC of 10 and hit points equal to 10 times the Cursed Energy spent. It can move up to 10 meters per turn, and its carrying capacity equals ¼ of your Charisma score times 15. If the hand takes damage, you take 1/10th of the damage, rounded down.

## Level 3: Improved Hand Creation (Technique Improvement)
Your technique has improved, allowing you to increase the size of your hand. 

You can summon it as an action by expending a number of cursed energy points up to your Charisma modifier. It still lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it, but it is now medium-sized. It retains the same actions as before and is controlled as a bonus action, but it can now grapple large or smaller creatures.

When attempting to grapple an enemy, they must make an Athletics or Acrobatics check against your hand’s Athletics check, which uses your Charisma instead of Strength. Once a creature is grappled, the hand can freely move it. A creature can attempt to break free from the grapple at the end of its turns.

You can also attack without a weapon using this larger hand. The same rules apply as a weapon attack, but you deal your unarmed strike damage and do not need to be holding a weapon.

Additionally, the hand has an AC of 10 plus the energy spent and HP equal to 10 times the energy spent. Its movement speed increases to 20 meters, and its carrying capacity is now ½ your Charisma score times 15.

## Level 6: Hand Fling (Extension Technique)
You have mastered greater control over creatures held by your hand. You can now grab and fling them at will. 

While your hand is summoned, you may use a bonus action and spend 3 cursed energy to throw a grappled creature up to 10 meters. Upon landing, the creature takes 5d8 bludgeoning damage.

You can also throw willing creatures up to half this range without causing damage. If you throw them beyond this limit, they take damage as normal.

At 11th level, the range and damage increase to 20 meters and 7d8, at 17th level to 30 meters and 9d8, and at 20th level to 40 meters and 11d8.

## Level 10: Expert Hand Improvement (Technique Improvement)
Your mastery of this technique has advanced, increasing the size of your hand to large. 

This allows you to grapple huge or smaller creatures. 

When summoning your hand, you can now spend up to twice your Charisma modifier in cursed energy. Its movement speed also increases to 30 meters. Additionally, when you punch using the hand, it now deals two rolls of your unarmed strike damage.

You also gain a new attack with your hand, allowing you to push enemies back and slam them into a surface within range. While your hand is summoned, you can use an action and spend 8 cursed energy to slam a creature. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed, taking 16d12 bludgeoning damage. On a success, they resist the slam and take half as much damage.

This technique's damage increases to 19d12 at 11th level, 22d12 at 17th level, and 25d12 at 20th level.

Additionally, you can use your hand to fling an ally or yourself out of danger. When you or an ally is targeted by an attack, you can use your reaction and spend 4 cursed energy to throw them to safety. You may fling the target up to the safe range of your hand’s fling ability.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Cutie Honey (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have developed an extension technique that allows you to grab enemies in a new way.

You can now attempt to capture the attention of your target, but the target must have already been grabbed by your hand for this effect to apply. 

As an action, you can spend 10 cursed energy to force a creature within 30 meters to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature’s eyes turn into hearts, and they are compelled to look at you, unable to react to anyone’s actions except yours. On a success, the creature is not affected.

This effect lasts until the beginning of their next turn.

## Level 20: Perfect Hand Improvement (Technique Improvement)
You have finally mastered your technique, and your hand now gains the following benefits:

- It is now huge-sized, allowing you to grapple gargantuan-sized creatures.
- It has resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage.
- Its range extends to 40 meters.
- You can choose whether it deals force damage or bludgeoning damage on its attacks.
- When attacking, it now deals 3 rolls of your unarmed strike damage.
- The health of your hand is now equal to 20 times the cursed energy spent.
- The carry weight of your hand is equal to your Charisma modifier times 15.
- You can control the hand as a free action.

## Reverse Technique: Attention Lost
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

After mastering Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked your cursed technique reversal. You can now summon small feet that disrupt the focus of creatures.

As an action, you can spend 4 cursed energy to shoot out a bunch of little feet in a 10-meter cone. Creatures in this cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 5d6 bludgeoning damage and are confused for 1 minute. On a success, they take half damage and are not confused. Confused creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns.
