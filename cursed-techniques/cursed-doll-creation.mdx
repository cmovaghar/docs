As a user of the Cursed Doll Creation, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Cursed Doll Creation (Lapse Technique)
You have unlocked your innate technique, allowing you to create a cursed voodoo doll linked to your enemies. 

As an action, you can spend 3 cursed energy to attempt to infuse a creature’s essence into a doll. Choose one creature within 40 feet; the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, their essence is infused into the doll, while on a success, the attempt fails. You can only have one infused doll at a time, and the infused creature must remain within 40 feet of you to stay linked. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can remake the Charisma saving throw, breaking free on a success.

While a creature is infused, any damage dealt to the doll is partially transferred to them. However, the connection is still weak, causing the infused creature to take only one-fourth of the damage dealt to the doll. The doll itself cannot make saving throws, and damage inflicted upon it does not need to come from you.

## Level 3: Noose Manifestation (Extension Technique)
You have discovered a new method to affect creatures infused into your dolls. You can now wrap a noose around the doll, which also affects the infused creature. 

As an action, you may begin to hang the doll, causing the target to suffocate. A creature hung in this way can survive for a number of rounds equal to twice their Constitution modifier, with a minimum of 2 rounds. To maintain the hanging, you must spend 1 cursed energy per turn and concentrate. 

Additionally, a creature must be within 12 meters of a platform, structure, or building to tie the rope, which will suspend the creature 1 meter in the air for the duration. While hanging, the creature’s movement speed is reduced to 0 and cannot be increased.

The rope used to hang the creature has hit points equal to your Charisma score and an AC of 10 plus your Charisma modifier. 

At 10th level, the rope’s hit points increase to twice your Charisma score, and at 14th level, they increase to three times your Charisma score. At 17th level, the rope’s hit points increase to four times your Charisma score.

## Level 6: Defensive Manipulation (Extension Technique)
You have unlocked a new way to use your technique. You have learned that you can affect infused creatures in ways other than harming them. 

As a reaction, you may spend 5 cursed energy to force a creature affected by Cursed Doll Creation to make a Dexterity saving throw, causing both the doll and the creature to trip. On a failure, the creature loses its current action and falls prone.

## Level 10: Improved Infusion (Technique Improvement)
You have become more proficient at infusing targets into your dolls. 

You can now have two dolls active at once, allowing you to infuse two creatures simultaneously. 

Additionally, your range has increased, and you can now infuse a creature from up to 24 meters away, as well as affect them as long as you remain within 24 meters of the infused creature. 

You are also better at transferring damage, with half of the damage dealt to the doll now being transferred to the infused target.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Adamantine Infusion (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have discovered a new application of your technique, allowing you to infuse and reinforce Cursed Energy into your doll, thereby reinforcing the doll's targets with a layer of Cursed Energy. 

You can now infuse a friendly creature or ally following the same rules as infusing an enemy, except they can willingly fail the saving throw. 

While infused, as a Bonus Action, you may spend an amount of cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier plus twice, granting the creature temporary hit points equal to the amount spent, multiplied by four. This increases to six times at 17th level.

## Level 20: Infusion Mastery (Technique Improvement)
You have learned to infuse creatures more efficiently. 

You can now infuse creatures as a bonus action for 4 cursed energy. 

Additionally, by spending an extra 10 cursed energy when subjecting a creature to Cursed Doll Creation, you can make it so that the infused creature can only attempt to break free from the effect after one minute. 

You can also have 3 dolls infused at once. 

Your range has increased to 40 meters, up from 24 meters. 

Lastly, the full amount of damage dealt to the doll is now transferred to the infused creature.

## Technique Reversal: Copycat
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Having mastered Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked your cursed technique reversal. Normally, the dolls you create project what happens to them onto others, but now you can project what happens to you or others onto the dolls. 

As an action, for 6 cursed energy, you can imbue a doll with someone’s essence. The person must make a Charisma saving throw, or they can willingly fail. On a success, the person and the doll become linked, and the doll will mimic the person’s actions, though it can only walk around and act like the infused person.

If you then infuse a creature into the doll using your lapse technique, both creatures will be infused into the same doll. If the creature infused by your reversal takes damage, the doll will absorb the damage and project it onto the person who was infused by your lapse. The person infused by your lapse still operates within the same limits as usual.
