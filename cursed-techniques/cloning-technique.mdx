As a user of the Cloning Technique, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Cloning Technique (Lapse Technique)
You have learned the basics of your cloning technique. As an action, for 2 cursed energy, you can create a perfect clone of yourself within 1 meter. 

The clone has 1/4 of your maximum hit points (rounded down), as well as your class and racial features (excluding this feature). Any clone counts as yourself, allowing you to instantly know any information they acquire, as if you had acquired it. 

You can also switch bodies with any clone you currently have as a bonus action. The clone cannot use any features that require cursed energy. The maximum number of clones you can create is 1. 

You control your clones, and they act in the same turn as you do. If a clone dies, you cannot summon another clone to replace it for one minute. For each clone you currently have, the cost to summon another clone increases by 2 cursed energy.

At 14th level, your clones gain access to your cursed energy pool and cursed energy features, but they cannot open more than one Domain Expansion.

## Level 3: Two Clones (Technique Improvement)
You have gained mastery over your cloning technique, allowing you to create 2 clones. The maximum number of clones you can make is now 2.

Additionally, you can now switch places with your clones in response to incoming danger. When you would receive damage, as a reaction, you can spend 5 cursed energy to switch bodies with a clone, making the clone take the damage instead of you.

## Level 6: Three Clones (Technique Improvement)
The quantity of clones you can summon continues to grow. Your maximum number of clones you can create is now 3.

Additionally, your clones now have hit points equal to half your maximum hit points (rounded down), and you can switch bodies with your clones as a free action instead of a bonus action.

## Level 10: Four Clones (Technique Improvement)
With practice comes perfection; you have reached your peak in clone quantity. Your maximum number of clones you can create is now 4.

Additionally, your clones now have hit points equal to your maximum hit points.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Full Assault (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Youâ€™ve learned to overwhelm your opponents with clones. Whenever a clone is within 1 meter of another clone, it can make any attack rolls with advantage.

Additionally, while four of your clones are within 1 meter of a hostile creature, that creature will make all saving throws against you with disadvantage.

## Level 20: True Clone Potential (Technique Improvement)
You have reached the peak of your cloning technique, unlocking its full potential. Whenever you or any of your clones use a cursed energy-related feature that affects only yourself or the clone, such as Cursed Strike, Cursed Armor, or Cursed Patient Defense, the feature now affects all clones and yourself.

Additionally, you can now create clones as a bonus action.

## Technique Reversal: Object Cloning
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

With great mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique, you have discovered the reversal of your technique. 

You can now clone objects without using cursed energy, including ordinary objects and weapons. As an action, for 4 cursed energy, you can clone a non-magical or cursed energy-filled object or structure within sight. For every size category the object or structure is above medium, you must spend an additional +2 cursed energy. Objects and structures created this way have hit points calculated the same way as your clones' hit points, but they function identically to the original object or structure.

For 10 cursed energy, you can clone a common magical item or a semi-grade cursed tool. For 14 cursed energy, you can clone an uncommon magical item or a grade 3 cursed tool. Lastly, for 16 cursed energy, you can clone a rare magical item or a grade 2 cursed tool. Magical items and cursed tools created through this feature last for 1 hour.
