As a user of the Cursed Speech, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Vocal Cords
While Cursed Speech is an incredibly powerful technique, it places immense strain on the user's vocal cords.

***Vocal Cords Hit Points.*** Your vocal cords have a number of hit points equal to one-third of your hit point maximum (rounded up). You regain 1 vocal cord hit point at the start of each of your turns unless they are at 0. Any healing you receive also restores your vocal cords' hit points. Your vocal cords fully recover at the end of a short or long rest.

***Losing Vocal Cord Hit Points.*** Whenever you use a Cursed Word against a hostile creature (or a creature that is not your ally), your vocal cords lose 2 hit points per Cursed Energy spent on the word (before applying reductions). If your vocal cords reach 0 hit points, you cannot regain them unless you receive the effects of Reverse Cursed Technique or take a long rest. While at 0 vocal cord hit points, you cannot use Cursed Words and suffer one level of exhaustion at all times.

### Limited Vocabulary
With this technique, you lose the ability to speak coherently, as every verb you use has the potential to curse someone. Because of this, you cannot take the *Chanting* feat. You can still communicate using words that aren’t commands, such as “fish” or “food,” but any attempt to speak normally risks invoking a curse.

### Cursed Energy Dependent
The effectiveness of your Cursed Words is influenced by the difference in cursed energy between you and your target. Both Cursed Energy Superiority and Cursed Energy Inferiority apply, depending on whether you have more or less cursed energy than your opponent.

***Cursed Energy Superiority.*** For every 10 Cursed Energy you have above a creature, the DC to resist your Cursed Words increases by 1. This bonus cannot exceed your proficiency bonus. Additionally, for each +1 increase in the DC, the damage you take to your vocal cords is halved.

For example, if you have a +2 bonus from superior cursed energy, the damage to your vocal cords would be reduced to one-quarter of the original amount (halved twice).

***Cursed Energy Inferiority.*** For every 10 Cursed Energy a creature has above you, they gain a +1 bonus to their saving throws against your Cursed Words. This bonus cannot exceed their proficiency bonus.

Furthermore, for each +1 bonus the creature has, the damage you take to your vocal cords is multiplied, with the multiplier being twice the number of +1 bonuses.

For example, if a creature has a +3 bonus due to having more cursed energy than you, the damage you take to your vocal cords would be multiplied by 6.

## Level 1: Cursed Speech (Lapse Technique)
You were born with the Inumaki clan seal over your mouth, granting you the ability to curse others simply by speaking. However, doing so puts extreme strain on your vocal cords.

You have access to the following Cursed Words: 

- ***Don’t Move.*** You can spend 4 cursed energy as a bonus action or as a reaction to a hostile action you can see. A creature of your choice within 20 meters must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become unable to perform any activity requiring physical movement, as determined by your DM, until the beginning of your next turn.

- ***Return.*** You can spend 4 cursed energy as a bonus action or as a reaction to a shikigami moving or taking any action (Action, Bonus Action, Free Action) or reaction. The shikigami must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be desummoned. A shikigami may choose to fail this saving throw if the summoner is willing. 

- ***Run Away.*** You can spend 2 cursed energy as a bonus action or as a reaction to a creature moving within 20 meters of you. You force one target within range to succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be compelled to take the Dash action and immediately run as far as possible from you (even if it’s not their turn). This consumes their movement on their next turn if it wasn’t their turn already.

- ***Sleep.*** You can spend 4 cursed energy as a bonus action to cause a creature within 20 meters to fall into a deep slumber. They must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they fall unconscious for 1 minute, which can be ended early if they take damage or if a creature uses their action to wake them. Creatures with more than half their maximum hit points automatically succeed. 

- ***Blast Away.*** You can spend 4 cursed energy as a bonus action to launch a creature within 20 meters of you backward. They must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be thrown back a distance equal to 10 times your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 foot), taking 1d6 force damage for every 3 meters traveled. This increases to 1d8 at 5th level, 1d10 at 11th level, and 1d12 at 17th level.

- ***Explode.*** You can spend 6 cursed energy as a bonus action to cause a creature within 20 meters of you to explode from the inside out. They must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take fire damage equal to 1d8 for each point of your Charisma modifier, multiplied by two (minimum of 2). If they fail by 5 or more, they suffer First Degree Burns.

- ***Plummet.*** You can spend 6 cursed energy as a bonus action to create a strong gravitational force that incapacitates a creature within 20 meters of you. They must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take force damage equal to 1d8 for each point of your Charisma modifier, and be knocked prone. If they fail by 5 or more, they are also incapacitated until the beginning of your next turn.

- ***Get Crushed.*** You can spend 10 cursed energy as a bonus action to implode a creature within 20 meters of you. They must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or lose hit points equal to 1d12 for each point of your Charisma modifier, multiplied by two (minimum of 2). They also have disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws until the beginning of your next turn. If they fail by 5 or more, they are incapacitated for the duration.

- ***Get Twisted.*** You can spend 10 cursed energy as a bonus action to twist a body part of a creature within 20 meters of you. They must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or have the hit points of one of their limbs reduced to 0. This cannot affect the skull, neck, jaw, or torso.

- ***Die.*** You can spend 20 cursed energy as a bonus action to attempt to instantly kill a creature within 20 meters of you. If the creature's hit points are below 30 times your Charisma modifier, they must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or die instantly.

Each cursed word requires a single word to activate. Using this word at any point causes the corresponding Cursed Speech effect. Targeted creatures don’t need to understand your language or be able to hear your words to be affected.

***Cursed Shout.*** You can shout your cursed words, allowing them to reach more people. By increasing the action cost of a cursed word by one (free action → bonus action → action), you can target all creatures within a 20-meter circle centered on yourself. 

If no targets are affected by your Cursed Words, you don’t spend any Cursed Energy nor take any damage to your throat.

## Level 3: Quick Word (Technique Improvement)
With great training, you have honed your tongue and can now say one word with remarkable speed. Choose one of your cursed words. The action cost of that word is reduced by one (action → bonus action → free action), and if it can be used as a reaction, you gain one additional reaction specifically for using it (though you cannot use any other cursed words as a reaction in the same round).

Additionally, you can use the Ready action with the chosen word without spending an action, as long as it’s your turn.

You can change the chosen cursed word at the end of a long rest.

## Level 5: Voice Transmission (Technique Improvement)
You’ve discovered that your cursed speech can be transmitted through or even stored in devices. 

When you use cursed speech while a device is transmitting your voice in real time, such as during a phone call, you may choose for the range of your cursed speech to originate from the device instead of yourself. 

Additionally, if a device records your cursed speech, you can choose to have it stored in the device rather than taking effect immediately. The next time the recording is played, the effect of the cursed speech activates, originating from the device. 

If you use cursed speech while a usage is stored, the stored usage is lost; otherwise, the storage lasts until the recording is played, triggering the stored effect.

## Level 6: Cursed Energy Superiority (Technique Improvement)
Your superiority in cursed energy now further hinders a creature's ability to defend itself. If you have 10 or more cursed energy than the target, they make saving throws against your cursed words with disadvantage.

If they already have disadvantage from another source, they must roll three dice and choose the lowest result.

## Level 10: Iron Cords (Technique Improvement)
Due to the constant usage of your vocal cords, they have become stronger. Your vocal cords’ hit points now equal half of your maximum hit points (rounded up).

Additionally, whenever your vocal cords reach 0 hit points, you can make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a success, you are reduced to 1 hit point instead.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses after a short or long rest.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Cursed Whisper (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have uncovered the best methods for utilizing your technique through whispers. 

Once per round, you can whisper one of your cursed words. This reduces its range by half, but if the target's passive Perception is lower than your cursed energy DC, they make the saving throw with disadvantage. Additionally, creatures affected by this must use twice as many reactions to respond to your cursed word.

You cannot use *Cursed Shout* and *Cursed Whisper* with the same word.

## Level 20: Cursed Tongue (Technique Improvement)
You have mastered cursed speech, becoming one of the most deadly sorcerers alive. Every cursed word you know now benefits from *Quick Word*.

## Technique Reversal: Blessed Silence
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal`*

Having mastered Reverse Cursed Technique, you have gained the ability to reverse your technique. Instead of issuing commands with your speech, you can cancel them out with your silence. You can activate Blessed Silence as an action for 20 cursed energy. One creature within 40 meters of you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they are silenced, unable to speak, and suffer the effects of Blessed Silence for 1 minute. On a success, they become immune to this feature for 1 minute.

For the duration, the affected creature must make a Wisdom saving throw whenever they attempt to take an action. On a failure, they fail to take the action and skip it. On a success, they perform the action as normal.

Additionally, for the duration, you cannot speak and must concentrate as if concentrating on a spell. You may end your reversal technique at will.
