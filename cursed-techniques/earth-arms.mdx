As a user of the Earth Arms, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Earth Arms (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to manipulate stone, summoning large stone fists from the earth for 1 minute by spending 1 cursed energy as a bonus action while touching the ground with your arms. While the fists are summoned, you can replace an attack in your attack action with a melee or ranged cursed energy attack roll with a range of 10 meters. This fires a stone fist at a target, dealing damage equal to your unarmed strike as bludgeoning damage, and adding half your Charisma modifier (rounded down) to the damage.

At 5th level, you add your Charisma modifier to the damage. At 11th level, you add your Charisma modifier plus half your Charisma modifier (rounded down). At 17th level, you add twice your Charisma modifier to the damage.

Additionally, while your fists are summoned, you gain the following maneuver:

### Stone Slam
As an action, you can spend 5 cursed energy to smash your stone arms onto your enemies. A target within 15 meters must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 4d8 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half as much damage and aren’t knocked prone.

This technique's damage increases to 7d8 at 5th level, 10d8 at 11th level, 13d8 at 17th level, and 16d8 at 20th level.

## Level 3: Earthen Maneuvers (Extension Technique)
While your stone arms are summoned, you can perform a variety of maneuvers. 

As part of your attack action, you can spend 4 cursed energy to use one of the following maneuvers, but you can only use one maneuver per round. If you have already used one maneuver this round, you can spend an additional 2 cursed energy to use a second maneuver. You can choose from the following:

### Shattering Strike
You create a heavy stone fist and slam it into a target within 6 meters. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take damage equal to your Earth Arms and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half damage and are not knocked prone.

### Sweeping Smash
You sweep the ground with a wide arc of your stone arm, forcing all creatures in a 5-meter cone in front of you to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take damage equal to your Earth Arms and are pushed back 2 times your Charisma modifier in meters. On a success, they take half damage and are not pushed back.

### Earthen Launch
You hurl a large stone fist at a target within 20 meters. Make a ranged cursed energy attack roll. On a hit, the target takes damage equal to your Earth Arms and is knocked 2 times your Charisma modifier in meters into the air. If they land, they take fall damage equal to 1d6 per 3 meters.

### Pulverize
This cannot be used as part of the attack action.

As an action, you can spend 6 cursed energy to slam both of your stone fists down onto a single target within 3 meters. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take damage equal to your Earth Arms and are confused until the end of their turn. On a success, they take half damage and are not confused.

## Level 6: Harder Stone (Technique Improvement)
Your mastery of earth manipulation allows you to harness the power of your stone arms more effectively. 

When your stone arms are summoned, you can make ranged cursed energy attack rolls with a range of 20 meters. The damage of each attack is increased by a number of damage dice equal to your proficiency bonus.

Additionally, if you have already used a second Earthen Maneuver, you can spend an additional 2 cursed energy to use a third Earthen Maneuver within the same round.

Finally, creatures with a Dexterity score lower than your Charisma score have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws against your Earth Arm features.

## Level 10: Stone Grasp (Extension Technique)
You have learned a new way to use the stone arms you create. You can now summon two large arms capable of catching a target. 

As an action, by spending 10 cursed energy, you can force a target within 20 meters to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they are wedged between the arms, taking 14d12 bludgeoning damage and becoming restrained, stuck between the hands. On a success, they are not restrained and take half damage.

This technique’s damage increases to 17d12 at 11th level, to 20d12 at 17th level, and to 23d12 at 20th level.

You may also keep the hands active once you have grabbed an enemy with this attack. If you do, every turn you keep the hands active, you can use a bonus action to squeeze the creature stuck between them, forcing them to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take another 5d12 bludgeoning damage from being squished. On a success, they break free. While keeping the hands active and holding a creature, you must maintain concentration.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Earthquake Strike (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Your mastery of the Earth Arms technique allows you to create devastating shockwaves that resonate through the ground. 

When you hit a target with your ranged Earth Arms attack, you can choose to unleash a shockwave by spending 10 additional cursed energy. This shockwave forces all creatures within a 6-meter radius of the target to make a Dexterity saving throw.

On a failed save, creatures take damage equal to your Earth Arm damage as thunder damage and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not knocked prone. Additionally, the shockwave creates difficult terrain in the area for 1 minute due to the upheaval of the ground.

## Level 20: Seismic Mastery (Technique Improvement)
Your mastery of the Earth Arms technique allows you to create small tectonic shifts with your movements. 

While your Earth Arms are active, the ground around you trembles, granting you the following benefits:

- Whenever you successfully hit a creature with your Stone Slam or any attack using your Earth Arms, the ground shifts beneath them. All creatures within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to your Earth Arm features’ damage again and be knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half damage and remain standing.
- Creatures targeted by your Earth Arms features have disadvantage on Strength saving throws against your Earth Arms, unless their Strength score is higher than your Charisma score.

## Technique Reversal: Air Slam
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

After mastering both Reverse Cursed Technique and your innate technique, you have learned how to use your cursed technique reversal. One major weakness of your innate ability is that all your abilities must originate from the ground, allowing flying enemies to easily escape your grasp. 

As an action, by spending 10 cursed energy, you can create a large hand in the air made out of your cursed energy. You may create this hand up to 40 meters away from you. The hand occupies a 5-meter radius area and targets creatures directly below it.

Creatures under the hand must make a Strength saving throw as the hand slams them toward the ground. On a failure, they take 5d12 bludgeoning damage for every 3 meters they fall before hitting the ground and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half damage and are not knocked prone.
