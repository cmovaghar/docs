As a user of the Puppet Manipulation, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Unique Puppet Creation
Your technique enables you to create unique modifications that no one else can access.

- At 1st level, you gain the *Sword Option* and *Ultra Shield* modifications.
- At 3rd level, you gain the *Boost On* modification.
- At 5th level, you gain the *Ultra Cannon* modification.
- At 11th level, you gain the *Mode: Albatross* modification.
- And finally, at 17th level, you gain the *Mode: Absolute*, *Miracle Cannon*, *Pigeon Viola*, and *Finger Cannon* modifications.

## Level 1: Cursed Corpse Creation
You gain the *Cursed Corpse Creator* feat, allowing you to create cursed corpses of any size. You begin with one Medium cursed corpse that can only have Grade 4 modifications. Additionally, you can control a number of cursed corpses within 10 meters of you as a bonus action, up to a maximum equal to twice your proficiency bonus.

You also gain access to Cursed Corpse Swarms. A swarm must contain at least two cursed corpses and can include up to twice your proficiency bonus in corpses. The corpses in a swarm must be Medium-sized or smaller. The swarm's AC is the median AC of all the cursed corpses within it, and its maximum hit points equal half the combined maximum hit points (rounded down) of all cursed corpses in the swarm. The swarm also gains the Swarm and Crowd Control Vulnerability traits.

The swarm can take actions equal to the number of corpses within it, up to twice your proficiency bonus. If the swarm is at half its maximum hit points or lower, it can only take half as many actions. Player-character cursed corpses can never be part of a swarm. You can still control individual cursed corpses within a swarm as normal. You can have a number of swarms up to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), and each swarm counts as two cursed corpses for the purpose of how many you can control.

## Level 3: Puppet Manipulation (Lapse Technique)
You have unlocked your Lapse Technique, greatly enhancing your ability to control and maintain cursed corpses over a vast distance. Controlling a cursed corpse no longer requires a bonus action, and they can follow more complex commands. They take their turns at the start of your turn. Additionally, you can see through their eyes and speak through them.

As a bonus action, you can spend Cursed Energy up to your Charisma modifier to extend the range at which you can control your cursed corpses, increasing it by 500 meters per Cursed Energy spent. This extended range lasts for one week.

Cursed corpses within this range can also receive Cursed Energy from you remotely. As a bonus action, you can transfer Cursed Energy from your pool to theirs, up to their maximum. Additionally, cursed corpses within your range may spend Cursed Energy directly from your pool instead of their own.

At higher levels, the range increase per Cursed Energy spent improves as follows:

- 5th level: 1 km per Cursed Energy
- 11th level: 1.5 km per Cursed Energy
- 17th level: 2 km per Cursed Energy
- 20th level: 2.5 km per Cursed Energy

## Level 6: Masterful Puppet Creation (Technique Improvement)
Your mastery of puppet creation is so refined that the materials you use surpass their original purpose. When using materials for a cursed corpse, they count as one grade higher for the purposes of their effects.

## Level 10 : Efficient Transfer (Technique Improvement)
You have become more proficient at imbuing cursed corpses with Cursed Energy. Whenever you imbue a core or recharge a cursed corpse, each point of Cursed Energy counts as 2. For example, if you imbue 10 Cursed Energy, it would count as 20.

Additionally, you can enhance your cursed corpses with more modifications. Each corpse can now hold an additional number of modifications equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up).

## Level 14 : Tokyo School Feature - Unique Core Creation (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

While other schools focus on the practicality of puppets, the Tokyo School has encouraged you to refine their internal components. When imbuing energy into a cursed core, you can now imbue an additional amount of Cursed Energy, up to double your *Charisma* modifier.

Additionally, you have learned to incorporate body parts from other creatures into your cursed corpses. During a long rest, if you have the body of a dead creature, you may graft its body parts onto one of your cursed corpses, granting it a unique effect. Work with your DM to determine the specific benefits.

## Level 20: Deus Ex Machina (Technique Improvement)
Your mastery over cursed corpse manipulation has advanced to the point where you require minimal Cursed Energy to sustain them. Whenever you imbue a core or recharge a cursed corpse, each point of Cursed Energy now counts as 4. For example, if you imbue 10 Cursed Energy, it would count as 40.

Furthermore, you can enhance your cursed corpses even further. Each corpse can now hold an additional number of modifications equal to your proficiency bonus.

Additionally, the time required to create cursed corpses is now halved.

## Technique Reversal: Sever Control
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal`*

You have unlocked your Cursed Technique Reversal, allowing you to sever the connection between a summoner and their summons. Instead of controlling puppets, you can now disrupt others' control over their own.

As an action, you can spend 5 Cursed Energy to target a creature within 20 meters of you or one of your puppets who currently controls a summon. The target must make a Charisma saving throw.

On a failure, they lose control over their summons for 1 minute, causing them to go berserk for the duration. The target may attempt to regain control by making another Charisma saving throw at the start of their turn.

On a success, they retain control, and nothing happens.
