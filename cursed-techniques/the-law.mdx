As a user of The Law, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Domain Expansion - Deadly Sentencing
Your Domain Expansion manifests as a place where true justice reigns. 

As an action, you expand your domain in a 10-meter radius, choosing one target within it to be put on trial. The domain transforms into a small courtroom, where you and your target take the roles of prosecutor and defendant. Guillotines line the background. This domain is non-lethal by nature.

Inside Deadly Sentencing, the sure-hit effect prevents all creatures, including yourself, from committing any act of violence.

The first time you use Deadly Sentencing each day, it costs nothing. After that, it costs 30 Cursed Energy. However:

- Every time you successfully convict a creature, you gain an additional free use of your domain that day.
- You also gain Refinement Points as if you had reduced the guilty creature to 0 HP.
- You regain all free domain uses at the end of a long rest.

### The Trial
Your domain enforces a trial-based cursed technique, presided over by your shikigami, Judgeman. When the trial begins, Judgeman announces charges against the defendant—crimes they may or may not have committed, as determined by the DM. Judgeman automatically knows everything about every creature inside the domain, but this information is not shared with you. The verdict is based entirely on the arguments presented by both parties.

The defendant must respond to the charges in one of three ways:
- ***Confession.*** Automatically results in a guilty verdict.
- ***Silence.*** Leads to a guilty verdict if the evidence is sufficient.
- ***Denial.*** The defendant may lie to defend themselves. Their goal is to remove all doubt and convince Judgeman of their innocence. Lies can be cross-examined through Deception vs. Insight checks from both sides.

The prosecutor (you) may present a rebuttal based on evidence provided by Judgeman. The evidence appears as a sealed envelope, which you cannot reveal until after the defendant makes their statement. However, Judgeman informs you of its contents beforehand. If the evidence is only loosely connected, you must roll a Persuasion check to convince Judgeman of its relevance, with DCs as follows:

|Difficulty|DC|
|:-|:-:|
|Slight reach|10|
|Moderate reach|15|
|Hard reach|20|
|Exceedingly hard reach|25|
|Nearly impossible reach|30|
|Completely impossible reach|45|

On a success, the argument is accepted regardless of logic.

### The Verdict
Once both sides present their cases, Judgeman (the DM) delivers a lawful verdict.

***If found innocent.*** The domain ends, and you suffer 1 level of exhaustion for 1 minute, during which you cannot use your innate technique features.


***If found guilty.*** The domain ends without domain burnout, but you cannot reopen your domain while the punishment is active. The severity of the punishment depends on the crime, as determined by the DM:
- Confiscation (for lesser crimes like theft).
- Death Penalty (for major crimes like murder).
- Both Confiscation and Death Penalty (for the most severe offenses).

#### Confiscation
The guilty party loses access to their Cursed Technique features for 1 minute. During this time, all other cursed energy-fueled features cost double their normal amount. 

If the target has no Cursed Technique, they instead lose access to all cursed energy-fueled features for 1 minute.

***Retrial Mechanic.*** While affected by Confiscation but not Death Penalty, the creature may make an Insight check against your Cursed Energy DC as an action. On a success, they figure out your technique and may request a retrial as a bonus action.

#### Death Penalty
The harshest punishment. The guilty party suffers Confiscation for 2 minutes, but in addition:

- Your gavel transforms into an executioner’s sword, functioning as a longsword.
- You can only attack the guilty creature with it.
- You use Charisma for attack and damage rolls.
- On a hit, it deals 5d12 radiant damage, which ignores resistances and immunities.
- The target gains one level of exhaustion per hit.

After 2 minutes, the sword disappears.

## Level 3: Gavel (Lapse Technique)
Your unwavering sense of justice has manifested in a powerful technique, granting you a cursed tool called Gavel. 

You use your Charisma modifier for both its attack and damage rolls. As a bonus action, you may spend X cursed energy to summon one of the following gavel types

If you stop holding a gavel, it disappears immediately. It also vanishes automatically after one minute. You may only have one type of Gavel summoned at a time.

|Type of Action|Cursed Energy Cost|Properties|Damage|
|:-|:-:|:-|:-|
|Gavel|1|Light, thrown(6/20)|1d4 + your Charisma modifier bludgeoning damage + 1d4 + your Charisma modifier necrotic damage|
|Staff Gavel|2|Versatile|1d6 (1d8) + your Charisma modifier bludgeoning damage + 1d6(1d8) + your Charisma modifier necrotic damage|
|Whip Gavel|3|Reach|1d10 + your Charisma modifier bludgeoning damage + 1d10 + your Charisma modifier necrotic damage|
|Giant Gavel|5|Heavy, two-handed, special|2d8 + your Charisma modifier bludgeoning damage + 2d8 + your Charisma modifier necrotic damage|

### Whip Gavel
You may replace one of your attacks during your Attack action with a ranged cursed energy attack against a creature within 6 meters. On a hit, the target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Giant Gavel
Instead of making an attack roll, you can use your action to force all creatures in a 1-meter radius in front of you to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take the Giant Gavel’s damage and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half damage and remain standing.

If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, they are restrained under the gavel. At the start of their turn, they must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take full damage again and remain restrained. If you move from the original spot where you used Giant Gavel, restrained creatures are immediately freed.

## Level 6: Facts and Logic
You understand the necessity of being cold and analytical to win your cases. You gain advantage on saving throws against being frightened and charmed.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion and Insight skills. If you are already proficient, you gain expertise instead.

***Ruthless Cross-Examination.*** Once per short rest, when making a Persuasion or Deception check during a trial, you may decide before the roll to roll with advantage.

## Level 10: Sorcerer Advocate
Your mastery of the law allows you to manipulate the flow of the trial in your favor. 

Whenever you use your Domain, you gain the following benefits:

***Legal Maneuvering.*** You may use Ruthless Cross-Examination from your Facts and Logics feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per domain use.

***Evidence Manipulation.*** Once per domain use, you can choose to reroll one of your dice rolls made for evidence submissions during trials. You must take the new result, even if it’s worse.

***Intelligent Arguments.*** You gain proficiency in the Investigation skill. If you are already proficient, you gain expertise instead.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature: Corruption
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned to win at any cost. 

As an action during your Domain, you may spend 20 cursed energy to submit fake evidence of your choice to Judgeman. This can only be done once per trial. 

The evidence is presented as legitimate, and Judgeman will consider it as such unless the defense successfully exposes it through a Deception check or another method of scrutiny.

## Level 20: Perfect Lawyer
You have perfected your lawyer abilities to the absolute maximum. 

Whenever you roll a Persuasion check to submit subpar evidence, you add your Charisma modifier to the roll an additional time.

In addition, all of your Gavels now deal one additional damage tier of damage.

## Technique Reversal: Proven Innocence
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Due to your unique technique and mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique, your reversal functions differently than others. Instead of following the usual method, your reversal operates within the confines of your domain. While the general properties of your domain, such as its appearance and range, remain unchanged, it now serves the purpose of proving the innocence of a deceased creature. If you witness a creature die within the domain’s range, you may use a reaction to open it in its reversed form. This costs the same amount of cursed energy as it would normally unless you have a free use available. When you activate the domain this way, the deceased creature and the one who killed them are drawn into it. For the duration of the domain, the deceased creature is revived.

Inside the domain, Judgeman will first announce the charges against the defendant. These charges are actual crimes they may or may not have committed, and they should be related to the defendant’s death (chosen by the Game Master). Judgeman automatically knows everything about everyone inside the domain, though this information is not shared with you. The trial’s verdict depends entirely on the arguments made by both sides.

After the accusation is presented, the defendant is given one opportunity to defend themselves. You may assist the defendant in proving their innocence. The defendant has three options: silence, confession, or denial. If they choose to deny the charges, they may lie in their statements. The goal of the defendant is to dispel all doubt and win a declaration of innocence from Judgeman. Any lies told by the defendant can be cross-examined by the prosecutor (Deception vs. Insight), as usual, and vice versa for the prosecutor’s lies. If the defendant confesses, the guilty verdict is automatic. If they remain silent, a guilty verdict will be given only if sufficient evidence is presented.

Judgeman will provide you with evidence to help prove the defendant’s innocence. The evidence appears as a sealed envelope in your hand. This evidence is not necessarily conclusive and will not be shared with the prosecutor until after their statement, though Judgeman will inform you of its contents when you receive it. Evidence that is only marginally related to the case may require a persuasion check to present effectively. The DC for this check depends on how much of a stretch the argument is: 10 for a slight reach, 15 for a moderate reach, 20 for a hard reach, 25 for an exceedingly hard reach, and 30 for a nearly impossible reach. A DC of 45 is required for a completely impossible argument.

The prosecutor also has one chance to make a statement. Their goal is to justify why they killed the defendant. After their statement, the prosecutor’s reasoning will be challenged by a persuasion check against your argument if it is insufficient. The DC for this check is based on the same scale as the persuasion check for presenting evidence: 15 for a slight reach, 20 for a moderate reach, 25 for a hard reach, 30 for an exceedingly hard reach, and 35 for a nearly impossible reach. A DC of 50 is required for a fully impossible argument.

Once both the prosecution and defense have made their statements, Judgeman (the Game Master) will deliver a lawful verdict. The party that presented the stronger argument will win the case. If the defendant is found innocent, the domain ends and they are revived with full hit points. If they are found guilty, they remain dead, and the domain ends. In the case of a guilty verdict, you will gain 1 level of exhaustion for 1 minute and cannot use any of your innate technique features.

Each time you prove a creature's innocence, you gain an additional free use of the domain for that day. You also gain refinement points as though you had reduced the creature to 0 hit points.
