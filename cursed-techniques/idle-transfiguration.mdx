As a user of the Idle Transfiguration, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Soul Technique
The Soul Dictates the Body. Your Innate Technique makes you nearly invincible to normal attacks. If you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you are incapacitated instead of unconscious, as the damage has not affected your soul.

***Soul Prodigy.*** If this is your Innate Technique, you gain *Soul Outline Awareness*. Whenever you gain soul knowledge, the amount is doubled, and you do not have disadvantage on Charisma saving throws to gain soul knowledge. If you already have a feature that negates the disadvantage, you instead gain advantage. Additionally, whenever a creature fails a saving throw caused by your Cursed Technique or you successfully hit a creature with your technique, you gain 1 point of soul knowledge.

## Level 1: Transfigured Creatures
Your technique allows you to twist the souls of others in grotesque ways. Whenever this technique refers to Transfigured creatures, the following rules apply. Whenever a creature becomes a transfigured creature, it now uses the stat block below.

### Transfigured Creature
*Any size Undead, unaligned*

- **AC** 10 + Dexterity modifier
- **HP** (See traits)
- **Speed** 10 m.
- **Initiative** +2 (12)

|   | Score |  MOD | SAVE |
|:--|:-:|:----:|:----:|
|**Str**|Their STR|||
|**Dex**|Their DEX|||
|**Con**|Their CON|||
|**Int**|  4|  --3 |  --3 |
|**Wis**|  4|  --3 |  --3 |
|**Cha**|  4|  --3 |  --3 |

- **Senses** Passive Perception 7

#### Traits
***Primitiveness.*** Transformed creatures lose all their supernatural abilities, including the use of spells and Cursed Techniques. They cannot gain proficiency in any skills and lose any proficiencies they previously had.

***Hit Points.*** The creature's hit points are calculated based on the number of dice equal to their hit dice when alive. Their hit point total is determined by their size tier, which is equal to their size category, plus their Constitution modifier.

#### Actions
***Unarmed Strike.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +Strength modifier, reach 1 m. *Hit*:  A number of d4s, starting with 1d4. For every size category above Tiny, the number of dice increases by one (e.g., a Small creature deals 2d4 damage, a Medium creature deals 3d4 damage, and so on). Additionally, if the creature's unarmed strike damage die tier was higher than a d4, it is changed to match the creature's size tier.

---

Once you have gained a transfigured creature, you may modify aspects of the creature during a short or long rest. You can modify a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) at once. You can control and command your transfigured creatures using the Summon Commanding Rules.

You can safely store your transfigured creatures within your body with no action required, and you can extract up to your Charisma modifier number of them as a bonus action. You can have a number of transfigured creatures equal to your Jujutsu Sorcerer level multiplied by your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). 

At 5th level, you can now modify them as a bonus action on your turn for 2 cursed energy, at 11th level you can do so as a free action, and at 17th level you can do it with no action required. Also, at 17th level, your transfigured creatures gain damage reduction equal to your Jujutsu Sorcerer level.

| Modification | Description |
|:-:|-|
| Size | You can reduce or increase their size, with a minimum of Tiny and a maximum of Large. At 5th level, you can increase their size up to Huge, and at 11th level, you can increase it up to Gargantuan. |
| Scores | When a creature becomes a Transfigured creature, their Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are reduced to 4. You may redistribute the points removed from their Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma into their Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution scores, up to 22 or their normal stat maximum, whichever is higher. At 5th level, you can increase these scores up to 24, up to 26 at 11th level, up to 28 at 17th level, and up to 30 at 20th level. |
| Tools (5th level) | You can create a weapon or object using one of your transfigured creatures. If it is a weapon, you use your Charisma modifier for its attack and damage rolls. It cannot be a cursed or magical weapon. At 11th level, the weapon's damage tier increases by one, by two at 17th level, and by three at 20th level. |
| Projectiles (5th level) | You can transform one of your transfigured creatures into a small projectile. As part of the action used to create it, you make a ranged cursed energy attack roll against a target within 4/20 meters. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 + your Charisma modifier + the creature’s CR in necrotic damage. |
| Beast (11th level) | You can transform one of your transfigured creatures into a beast. It takes the stat block of a beast with a CR up to your proficiency bonus but retains its original ability scores, size, and hit dice. It also gains the features of the chosen beast. |
| Vehicle (17th level) | You can transform one of your transfigured creatures into a vehicle of any size. The vehicle does not require fuel to move, but any components that would normally require ammunition or similar resources cannot be used. |

## Level 1: Idle Transfiguration (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to alter a creature’s very soul simply by touching it. 

As an action, or by replacing an attack as part of the attack action if you are grappling the creature, you can spend 4 cursed energy to make a melee weapon attack roll against the creature. On a hit, the creature takes 2d12 necrotic damage. The cursed energy is not spent if you miss.

The damage of this technique increases to 4d12 at 5th level, 8d12 at 11th level, 14d12 at 17th level, and 22d12 at 20th level.

This feature does not work against creatures without a soul. The necrotic damage from this feature bypasses resistances and immunities. Damage from this feature is considered Minor Soul Harming. Whenever you reduce a creature's hit points to 0 with this technique, you may choose to turn the creature into one of your Transfigured Creatures, causing it to gain a horrific appearance and lose all of its free will.

If you are using the Limbs System Variant rule, reducing a creature's limbs to 0 hit points will allow you to transfigure the limb itself. This will transfigure the limb, allowing it to be altered and shaped like a Transfigured Creature or Self Alteration, at your DM's discretion, or it will be destroyed completely.

A creature or limb that has been transfigured has had its soul altered, and as such, regaining hit points will not undo the transfiguration.

***Altering Allies.*** At 5th level, you can also use your alteration on a willing creature, modifying them as you see fit. You may alter a willing creature during a short or long rest, or as a full-turn action by spending 8 cursed energy, granting them one or more of the benefits listed in the table below.

You may grant a number of alterations to the same creature up to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). If you attempt to grant an additional alteration beyond this limit, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it loses one hit die and takes necrotic damage equal to the die’s maximum value, reducing its maximum hit points by the same amount. On a success, the creature loses its oldest alteration and gains the new one.

***A Direct Hit!*** At 11th level, you have discovered a way to more crudely and aggressively shape a creature's soul. When you hit a creature with Idle Transfiguration, you may forgo the damage and instead force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, nothing happens. On a failure, the creature takes half the damage it would normally take from Idle Transfiguration, but the damage is considered Major Soul Harming.

| Alteration | Description |
|-|-|
| Heightened Smell | The creature gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks involving smell. |
| Heightened Hearing | The creature gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks involving hearing. |
| Heightened Sight | The creature gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks involving sight. |
| Darkvision | The creature gains Darkvision up to 20 meters. If it already has Darkvision, its range increases by 10 meters. |
| Gills | The creature gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed and can breathe underwater. |
| Light Body (5th level) | The creature counts as one size smaller, but its walking speed increases by 2 meters. It cannot be reduced below Tiny. |
| Size Increase (5th level) | The creature’s size increases by one category, up to a maximum of Large. At 11th level, this maximum increases to Huge. At 17th level, it increases to Gargantuan. |
| Hardened Skin (5th level) | The creature gains resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing. |
| Restraint Removal (11th level) | The creature has one of its physical features or a specific part of that feature removed. This must be a natural part of its body and cannot include abilities like a Fighting Style. |
| Godly Endurance (17th level) | The creature gains a number of hit dice equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). It rolls all these dice at once, increasing its maximum hit points by the total rolled. |

## Level 3: Self-Alteration (Technique Improvement)
You have learned how to shape your own form in many different ways. You have 7 body slots. 

Head, Torso, Left Arm, Right Arm, Left Leg, Right Leg, and Body (When using Alterations on the Body slot specifically, you may affect a number of body slots up to your Charisma modifier, minimum of 1).

As a bonus action, by spending the required amount of Cursed Energy, you can reshape your body parts into different forms. You may choose to gain one of the following.

Each form's benefits are removed at the end of combat or if you deactivate them as a bonus action.

You can apply up to two Alterations to a single body slot simultaneously.

***Soul Maintenance.*** At 5th level, you have learned to heal yourself by altering your body. As a free action or as a reaction to taking damage, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) in cursed energy, regaining 25 times the amount spent in body hit points.

***Polymorph.*** At 11th level, you can fully transform your body into an animal. As an action, you can spend cursed energy equal to the beast's challenge rating (minimum 1) to transform into a beast for 1 minute, until you use this feature again, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. The new form must have a challenge rating equal to or less than your Jujutsu Sorcerer level. Your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores are replaced by those of the chosen beast, but you retain your alignment and personality.

You assume the hit points of your new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the hit points you had before transforming. If the transformation ends due to reaching 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage does not reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you remain conscious.

You gain the actions of the creature you transform into, but you may still perform your normal actions if the new form allows it.

Your gear melds into the new form, preventing you from activating, using, wielding, or benefiting from any of your equipment.

***Quickened Alterations.*** At 17th level, you have mastered body alteration, making it a much simpler task. When using Self-Alteration, Polymorph, or Instant Spirit Body of Distorted Killing, you may reduce their action cost by one step (full turn action → action → bonus action → free action). Additionally, you no longer need to use a bonus action to undo a Self-Alteration—instead, you may use your bonus action to directly switch from one alteration to another.

### Alterations

#### Weapon (4 Cursed Energy Per Slot)
All weapons you form with your body deal normal weapon damage plus your Charisma modifier in additional necrotic damage. All weapons you create must be non-magical melee weapons, but at 6th level, they count as magical for overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

#### Size (3 Cursed Energy Per Slot)
You can increase or decrease your body's size. 

- **Increasing Size:** For every size category above Medium, your unarmed strikes and body-created weapons deal an extra damage die, up to a maximum of Huge. Each size increase also grants advantage on Strength checks and saving throws. If you increase your size category above Medium by affecting your Body slot, Legs slot, or both, your movement speed increases by 1 meter per size category above Medium, up to a maximum of 2 meters for Huge.

- **Decreasing Size:** For every size category below Medium, your unarmed strikes and body-created weapons deal one damage die tier lower (to a minimum of 1 damage). Each size decrease also grants advantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws, and your movement speed increases by 1 meter per size category below Medium, up to a maximum of 5 meters for Tiny. You also gain the ability to move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing.

#### Shape (2+ Cursed Energy Per Slot)
You can distort your body's shape without fully transforming. You can:- Increase your reach by 1 meter for every 2 Cursed Energy spent.

- Shape your body into mundane objects of similar mass, such as keys, small shields, ropes, ladders, or even complex tools like lockpicks.
- Create temporary body parts (e.g., wings for gliding, fins for swimming, extra limbs for climbing or wielding more weapons). These temporary parts provide advantage on related ability checks. For limbs, it costs 2 Cursed Energy per limb.
- Transform your body into pliable substances, allowing you to squeeze through spaces as small as 1 inch in diameter.

#### Partial Beast (4 Cursed Energy Per Slot)
You can partially transform your body parts to mimic an animal without fully transforming. You can choose features or attacks from beast-type creatures with a CR up to your Charisma modifier. You can choose a number of features or attacks equal to your proficiency bonus. Any attack, movement, or other features that use the beast's modifiers instead use your own modifiers and abilities. If the feature or attack has a limited use, you can use it once per transformation.

## Level 6: Body Clone (Extension Technique)
You have learned to create an almost perfect clone of yourself. As an action, by spending half your cursed energy maximum and half your maximum hit points (both rounded up), you create a near-identical copy of yourself. 

This clone has half your maximum hit points and cursed energy. It is identical to you, acts on your turn, is controlled by you, and you can see through its eyes and hear through its ears. 

However, your clone cannot use any of your Innate Technique features except Self-Alteration. 

You cannot create another clone while your current one exists unless it dies or you touch it. If you touch your clone, you can choose to absorb it back into yourself, regaining the hit points and cursed energy originally spent to create it.

## Level 10: Soul Multiplicity (Extension Technique)
You have mastered two techniques that extend your ability to fuse your Transfigured Creatures. As an action, by spending 5 Cursed Energy, you can merge two or more of your Transfigured Creatures, creating one of the following effects:

***Body Repel.*** You launch a barrage of transfigured creature body parts at up to two creatures within 10 meters. Make a ranged Cursed Energy attack roll for each target. On a hit, they take 1d6 piercing damage and 2d8 necrotic damage. For each additional Transfigured Creature used in the fusion, you increase the necrotic damage by 1d8, extend the range by 1 meter, and can target an additional creature. You may target a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). At 11th level, you can add up to twice your Charisma modifier plus half your Charisma modifier (rounded down).
At 17th level, you can add up to three times your Charisma modifier.

Alternatively, you can create an omnidirectional barrage of soul hands, forcing all creatures within a 10-meter radius to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 1d6 piercing damage and 2d8 necrotic damage. On a success, they take half as much damage. For each additional Transfigured Creature used in the fusion, you increase the necrotic damage by 1d8 and expand the radius by 1 meter.

***Polymorphic Soul Isomer.*** You create a Polymorphic Soul Isomer. When using this technique, you can spend an additional 5 Cursed Energy to fuse another Transfigured Creature into the creation (minimum of 2). Each Transfigured Creature used in the fusion counts as one soul.

### Polymorphic Soul Isomer
*Medium Undead, unaligned*

- **AC** 14 (Natural Armor)
- **HP** 90 (20d8) 
- **Speed** 30 m.
- **Proficiency Bonus** +0
- **Initiative** +2 (12)

|   |   |  MOD | SAVE ||   |   |  MOD | SAVE ||   |   |  MOD | SAVE |
|:--|:-:|:----:|:----:|-|:--|:-:|:----:|:----:|-|:--|:-:|:----:|:----:|
|**Str**| 18|   +4 |   +4 ||**Dex**| 18|  +4 |   +4 ||**Con**|  8|  -1 |  -1 |
|**Int**| 10|   +0 |   +0 ||**Wis**|  4|  -3 |  -3 ||**Cha**|  4|  -3 |  -3 |

- **Immunities** Necrotic, Charmed, Frightened
- **Senses** Passive Perception 10
- **Languages** None
- **CR** 5 (1800 XP)

#### Traits
***Multi-Soul Instability.*** For each soul used to create the Polymorphic Soul Isomer, it gains +1 to its Strength score but loses 5 maximum hit points. For every 5 souls fused, its unarmed strike damage die increases by one tier.

If the Isomer’s maximum hit points reach 0 or lower due to this feature, it dies immediately, unable to take any actions, and the souls used in its creation are lost.

***Colossal Physique.*** The Polymorphic Soul Isomer counts as two sizes larger for grappling, shoving, disarming, and determining carrying capacity, push, drag, or lift limits. Any Strength-based attack roll made by the Isomer deals double damage to objects and structures.

Once per turn, when the Isomer hits with a melee attack, it can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC 15 + 1 per 2 souls used). On a failure, the target is knocked back (40 + 3 per 2 souls used) meters in a direction of the Isomer’s choice.

If the target collides with an unsecured object or structure, both take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 2 meters remaining in the knockback distance.

If the target collides with another creature, both take damage equal to half of the attack’s damage roll (rounded down).

If the attack was a critical hit, the target automatically fails the saving throw and is knocked back twice the distance.

When the Isomer makes a Strength check or saving throw, it can choose to roll with advantage. It can do this (4 + 1 per 2 souls used) times, regaining all uses after a long rest.

#### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The Polymorphic Soul Isomer makes 2 Unarmed Strike attacks.

***Unarmed Strike.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +7 (+1 per 2 souls used), reach 1 m. *Hit* 1d12 (increased by its die tier increases, if any) plus its Strength modifier Bludgeoning.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Advanced Alterations (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned to enhance your self-alterations to new heights after your time in Tokyo. Whenever you use a self-alteration, you can choose to spend twice the normal amount of cursed energy (before applying reductions) to amplify its effects. Additionally, you can now apply 3 alterations to a body part simultaneously. 

### Alterations

#### Weapon
All weapons you form with your body parts deal the normal weapon damage + your Charisma modifier added twice as additional necrotic damage. All weapons you create must be non-magical weapons, though they will count as magical. If you create a ranged weapon, you lose 1 hit point whenever you attack with it to replace its ammunition if you do not have any remaining.

#### Size 
You can increase or decrease your body's size. 

- **Increasing Size:** For every size category above Medium, your unarmed strikes and body-created weapons deal an extra damage die, up to a maximum of Gargantuan. Each size increase grants advantage on Strength checks and saving throws and a 1 bonus on those checks per size above Medium. If you increase your size by affecting your Body slot, Legs slot, or both, your movement speed increases by 2 meters per size category above Medium, up to a max of 10 meters for Gargantuan. 
- **Decreasing Size:** For every size category below Medium, your unarmed strikes and body-created weapons decrease by one damage die tier (minimum 1 damage). Each size decrease grants advantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws and a +1 bonus on those checks per size below Medium. Your movement speed increases by 2 meters per size category below Medium, up to a max of 20 meters for Tiny. You also gain the ability to move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing.

#### Shape
You can distort your body's shape without fully transforming. You can: 
- Increase your reach by 2 meters for every 2 Cursed Energy spent.
- Shape your body into mundane objects of similar, slightly heavier, or lighter mass (e.g., keys, rope, or even complex tools like lockpicks).
- Create temporary body parts (e.g., wings for gliding, fins for swimming, extra limbs, etc). These parts provide advantage on related ability checks and saving throws. For limbs, it costs 2 Cursed Energy per limb.
- Transform your body into pliable substances, allowing you to squeeze through spaces as small as 1 inch in diameter.

#### Partial Beast
You can partially transform your body parts to mimic an animal without fully transforming. You can choose features or attacks from beast-type creatures with a CR up to your Charisma modifier added twice. You can choose a number of features or attacks equal to your proficiency bonus. Any attack, movement, or other features that use the beast's modifiers instead use your own modifiers and abilities. If the feature or attack has limited uses, you can use it once per transformation.

## Level 20: Instant Spirit Body of Distorted Killing (Extension Technique)
You finally understand the true essence of your soul, unlocking its ultimate form. 

As a bonus action, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to transform your body into a more monstrous appearance. While the Instant Spirited Body Of Distorted Killing has hit points, you gain the following benefits:

- The Instant Spirited Body Of Distorted Killing has hit points equal to your Charisma modifier multiplied by 20. You can use Soul Maintenance to recover any lost hit points for this form.
- Your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma scores, including their maximums, each increase by 4.
- Your natural weapons and unarmed strikes deal an additional damage die.
- You deal twice as much damage to objects and structures.
- Dark tendrils sprout from your body. As a reaction to a melee weapon attack roll against you, you can make an unarmed strike against the attacker. If your unarmed strike roll exceeds the attack roll, the attack is negated. You can also use these tendrils as an unarmed strike, dealing damage equal to your unarmed strike damage.
- You grow a large tail with reach, which counts as a natural weapon. On a hit, it deals 3d10 + your Strength modifier in bludgeoning damage.
- You can use your Charisma modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity for melee weapon attack and damage rolls.

Maintaining the Instant Spirited Body of Distorted Killing requires concentration.

***Soul Reinforcement.*** Due to the true form of your soul enhancing your entire body, concentration works differently. You only need to make a concentration check if you're hit in an area where the hit points from this feature don't apply. For example, if the hit points from this feature are depleted in your arm, and your arm’s armor is destroyed, you only make the concentration check if you're hit in your real arm, unaffected by the Instant Spirited Body of Distorted Killing's hit points.

You can deactivate the Instant Spirited Body of Distorted Killing at will, with no action required.

## Technique Reversal: Object Transfiguration
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have learned how to reverse your technique, achieving your technique reversal. Each time you use this reversal, you gain 1 Object Awareness, which may be doubled by Soul Prodigy.

As a bonus action, while holding or touching an object or weapon, you can spend Cursed Energy up to four times your proficiency bonus. For every 8 Cursed Energy spent, you may change one property of the object. The Special property costs 16 Cursed Energy instead of 8, and you must work with your DM to determine its rules. These transfigurations last until you dismiss them as a free action while holding or touching the object.
