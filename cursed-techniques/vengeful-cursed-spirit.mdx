As a user of the Vengeful Cursed Spirit, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Cursed Rarity
You are an extreme anomaly, even by the standards of the Jujutsu world. 

You gain the Cursed Partner Background feat, with your spirit possessing no innate technique. 

Your [Vengeful Spirit](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Vengeful_Spirit_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)), Boundless Potential, and Pure Love, Pure Wrath features do not count as innate technique features.

## Level 1: Boundless Potential (Cursed Energy Feature)
Whether by ancestry or pure chance, your curse is more peculiar than others. 

For the purposes of calculating your Vengeful Spirit's ability scores, you count as being double your level. When calculating the spirit's cursed energy, you use your full cursed energy maximum.

## Level 1: Pure Love, Pure Wrath (Cursed Energy Feature)
You have realized that your spirit possesses an abundance of cursed energy, which can be unleashed in the form of a large beam. While your spirit is fully manifested, you are able to channel its cursed energy into this beam.

As an action, you may spend an amount of cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier to force creatures within a 3-meter wide, 20-meter long line to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 1d12 force damage for every point of cursed energy spent and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and are not knocked prone. Objects within the area also take damage, double the damage that a creature would take. Your spirit can also use the cursed energy beam on its own.

At 5th level, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier plus half your Charisma modifier (rounded down). 

At 11th level, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier added twice. 

At 17th level, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier added twice plus half your Charisma modifier (rounded down). 

At 20th level, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier added thrice.

## Level 6: Copy (Lapse Technique)
You have finally unlocked your Innate Technique, Copy. In order to copy a creature's innate technique, you must have your spirit ingest a portion of the target’s body. If the creature’s CR or level is lower than your own, it is easier to copy from them as you do not need as much of their body.

As a bonus action, while your Vengeful Spirit is fully manifested, you can command it to make a claw attack against a creature. If the attack hits, the Vengeful Spirit can extract a sample of the creature's DNA. Afterward, you can attempt to replicate their technique by making a Charisma saving throw. On a success, you copy the creature’s Cursed Technique. On a failure, you do not copy the technique.

The DC to copy a Cursed Technique is equal to the Cursed Energy DC of the Sorcerer you’re trying to copy.

If the creature has a CR or level equal to or higher than yours, you need a more significant body part to copy the technique. Once the creature is below half hit points or has had a limb reduced to 0 hit points, your Vengeful Spirit can extract a large enough portion of the creature’s body to copy their technique. As a bonus action, once these conditions are met, you can command your Vengeful Spirit to make another claw attack against the creature. If it hits, it can extract the DNA from the destroyed limb or the lethal body part. Afterward, you can make the Charisma saving throw to attempt to copy their Cursed Technique.

Additionally, if a creature heals the damage you dealt in order to copy their technique or heals the destroyed limb you used to copy, the copied technique is lost and you no longer have access to it. If a creature dies before they can heal the damage or limb, you retain the copied technique after their death. Any features copied prior to obtaining the Freed Spirit feat must be copied again under the conditional rules.

When you successfully copy a Cursed Technique, you must spend as much Cursed Energy as the technique’s Lapse requires.

### Copied Techniques
Whenever you copy an innate technique, you gain its Lapse Technique and any Technique Improvements tied to it, as long as you meet the required level. You must also abide by any features directly tied to the Lapse (e.g., the ‘Active Use Technique’ feature of the Brain Technique).

When you copy a Cursed Technique, you act as though you are at 1st level with that technique for the purposes of features that scale with your level. Upon seeing a feature you’ve copied being used in combat, as a bonus action, you may attempt a DC 20 Charisma saving throw to advance that feature’s scaling (e.g., going from 1st level to 5th level). Alternatively, after a short or long rest, you may attempt this saving throw to improve the feature. The DC to improve it decreases by 5 for every long rest you take to train it. This cannot improve a feature beyond your current level.

Additionally, incantations for the Chanting cursed feat must also be learned. You may attempt the same DC 20 Charisma saving throw to use a chant when you see it being used. Alternatively, on a short or long rest, you can make this saving throw to improve the feature, with the DC decreasing by 5 for every long rest you attempt to train it.

If you have the Jujutsu Genius or Six Eyes feats, you have advantage on the Charisma saving throw to increase your feature levels and learn incantations.

You can store up to your proficiency bonus worth of copied techniques in your Vengeful Spirit. If you copy a new innate technique that exceeds this limit, you must choose which technique to remove.

### Using Copied Techniques
In order to use any of the techniques you’ve copied, your Vengeful Spirit must be Fully Manifested and within 200 feet of you.

You can only use one Cursed Technique at a time. Once per round, you may "switch" to another copied innate technique without using an action. However, if you are actively using one of your Cursed Techniques (such as a summoned shikigami, a duration-based ability, or any other ongoing effect), activating another Cursed Technique will immediately end all effects of the current technique. This includes any summoned entities, sustained abilities, or residual effects tied to the active technique. Additionally, you cannot use extra actions, reactions, or bonus actions granted by one Cursed Technique to activate or use another.

If you are at Tokyo Jujutsu High School, your Tokyo Enhancements and Specialized Technique must be applied individually to the copied Cursed Techniques after finishing a long rest. For example, if you copy the Sky Manipulation technique during an encounter, you may choose to apply your Specialized Technique to the Sky Manipulation Lapse or Thin Ice Breaker Extension technique during the next long rest.

### Technique Analysis
At 11th level, you learn to analyze the techniques you’ve copied, understanding their operation and functions. You will automatically learn the capabilities of the Lapse Technique and its target concept. Some information may still elude you, as determined by the DM. For example, if you copy the Brain Technique, you will not learn the operation of the Active Use Technique.

You cannot imbue copied techniques into weapons using the Technique Imbued Cursed Tools rule.

## Level 10: Extended Copy (Technique Improvement)
You have now expanded your Copy Technique, gaining the ability to replicate and utilize Extension Techniques. With your growing mastery over techniques, you can now learn and use more complex applications of Cursed Techniques.

After you have successfully copied a Cursed Technique, if you have witnessed an Extension Technique being used and meet the required level to use it, you can attempt to learn the technique. You may use a bonus action to make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a success, you learn the Extension Technique and count as having the lowest level of scaling for the purpose of features that scale with the technique’s level. You can then progress and increase your scaling as you gain levels. Alternatively, after a short or long rest, you can attempt to learn the feature, with the DC for the Charisma saving throw decreasing by 5 each long rest you spend attempting to train it.

If you have the Jujutsu Genius or Six Eyes feats, you gain advantage on these Charisma saving throws to learn Extension Techniques.

If you are using the Extension Techniques variant rule, you may also copy Extension Techniques made with that rule, at your DM’s discretion. Additionally, you can attempt to develop Extension Techniques based on the Innate Techniques you’ve copied. However, this process is more difficult and time-consuming than it would be for someone who is the original user of the technique.

This advancement in your powers further solidifies your position as a formidable and adaptable force, as you can not only copy techniques but also push their boundaries into new and complex territory.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Instantaneous Copy (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

when you try to copy a technique, you may spend 10 Cursed Energy to instantly pass the Charisma saving throw. If the DC is higher than what you can achieve, you must spend 20 cursed energy instead. 

## Level 20: Improved Technique Analysis (Technique Improvement)
Your ability to analyze techniques you've copied is exceptional, enabling you to quickly extract information about them. 

When you first copy an Innate Technique, you will be treated as one tier higher than your starting level for features that scale with your level. Furthermore, you will automatically succeed on the saving throw to copy a technique you've already copied.

## Technique Reversal: Duplicated Reversal
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

With your mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique, you can now replicate the reversal features of the cursed techniques you've copied.
