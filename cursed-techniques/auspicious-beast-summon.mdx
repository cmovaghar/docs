As a user of the Auspicious Beast Summon, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Auspicious Beast Summon (Lapse Technique)

You have awakened your cursed technique, Auspicious Beast Summon. The spirits you call upon bestow you with a boon to serve as their medium, but this boon only activates when your face is shrouded in some way. 

You start with a non-magical, non-cursed tool mask as part of your starting equipment.

When wearing a face covering, you can summon one of the following beasts:

### Auspicious Beast Number One - Kaichi
As a bonus action, for 2 cursed energy, you can funnel your cursed energy to summon Kaichi, a floating horn. You can then make a ranged Cursed Energy attack roll using Kaichi with a range of 20 meters, either as an action or bonus action. On a hit, Kaichi deals 1d10 + your Charisma modifier piercing damage. If the attack roll misses, you may spend 2 additional cursed energy to reroll the attack. You can use this feature up to a number of times per turn equal to your proficiency bonus. Kaichi has an AC equal to your Cursed Energy save DC, hit points equal to twice your Charisma score, and can have its saving throws influenced by you. By spending 1 cursed energy, you can make a Charisma saving throw for Kaichi instead of its normal saving throw. The damage of Kaichi increases as follows: 2d10 at 5th level, 4d10 at 11th level, 7d10 at 17th level, and 11d10 at 20th level. Additionally, at 5th level, you can make one attack with Kaichi as part of your Attack action once per turn, which increases to twice per turn at 17th level.
Kaichi lasts a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus.

### Auspicious Beast Number Two - Reiki
As a bonus action for 3 cursed energy, you can transmute your cursed energy to coat your body with water. While Reiki is activated, you gain the following benefits:

- Your movement speed is doubled, and you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
- You are immune to the prone condition.
- You can take the Dodge action as a bonus action.
- As a reaction for 2 cursed energy, when an attack is made against you, you can increase your AC by your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) against that attack. This bonus lasts until the start of your next turn and does not stack if used multiple times.

Reiki lasts a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus.

### Auspicious Beast Number Three - Kirin
As a bonus action or as a reaction to an attack targeting you, for 3 cursed energy, you can enhance your body by nullifying your senses and applying pressure to them. While Kirin is activated, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- You gain damage reduction to all damage types (excluding psychic, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing) equal to your Charisma modifier.
- You cannot be incapacitated or fall unconscious unless your hit points are reduced to 0. Additionally, you temporarily reduce any levels of exhaustion by 1 while Kirin is active.

Kirin lasts a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus. Once this summon ends, you must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute.

### Auspicious Beast Number Four - Ryu
As an action, for a number of cursed energy equal to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus, you can summon Ryu, a large serpentine dragon-like creature, formed from the concentrated cursed energy around your hands. 

While Ryu is active, you may use a bonus action to make a melee Cursed Energy attack against a target within 12 meters. On a hit, the attack deals Xd10 necrotic damage (the x in the damage calculation is twice the amount spent on activation), and for the purposes of other features, you are considered to be Ryu himself when attacking. 

Ryu has an AC of 10 + the amount of cursed energy spent on the technique, and hit points equal to 15 times the amount spent. While Ryu is alive, you can continue using your bonus action to attack. 

The dragon lasts until it is slain, dismissed, or for 1 minute. 

## Level 3: Piercing Horn (Technique Improvement)
Kaichi has become sharper than ever, now able to pierce through its targets with greater precision. 

If you roll a 20 on the ranged Cursed Energy attack roll when hitting with Kaichi, you can choose to have the horn become lodged in the target, overcoming any temporary hit points. The target may attempt to remove the horn by making a Strength saving throw at the start of its turns. On a failure, they cannot remove the horn and continue to take damage equal to Kaichi's damage die. On a success, they can remove Kaichi, ending the technique early. This effect lasts until you use Kaichi to attack another target or the technique ends.

At 5th level, this effect also triggers on a roll of 19. At 11th level, it works on a roll of 18. At 17th level, it works on a roll of 17, and at 20th level, it works on a roll of 16.

## Level 6: Swift Moves (Technique Improvement)
Reiki has become faster and more acrobatic. While under the benefits of Reiki, you gain the following advantages:

- Your movement speed is tripled, and you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, doubled.
- You are immune to both the prone and restrained conditions.
- You can take the Dodge and Disengage actions as a bonus action.
- As a reaction for 1 cursed energy when an attack is made against you, you can increase your AC by your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) against the triggering attack. This bonus lasts until the start of your next turn and does not stack if used multiple times.

## Level 10: Impenetrable Skin (Technique Improvement)
Kirin has become more durable and now drains you less when activated. You gain the following benefits while Kirin is active:

- You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as resistance to one additional damage type of your choice (excluding Psychic, Radiant, or Necrotic).
- You gain damage reduction to all damage types (excluding psychic, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing) equal to twice your Charisma modifier.
- You cannot be incapacitated or fall unconscious unless your hit points are reduced to 0. Additionally, you temporarily reduce any levels of exhaustion by 2 while Kirin is activated.

Furthermore, Kirin now drains less energy from you. Once the summon ends, you must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you become stunned for 10 - your Charisma modifier rounds. On a success, your speed is halved until the beginning of your next turn.

The DC for this saving throw decreases to 20 at 11th level, 15 at 17th level, and 10 at 20th level.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Auspicious Tendencies (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

While studying at Tokyo, you have learned to draw even more power from the spirits when becoming their medium. You can now further empower your Auspicious Beasts by channeling their powers, transforming them into their Dire Forms. 

After a Dire Form ends, you can continue using your regular beast's summon for half the normal duration (rounded down).

When summoning a beast, you may spend an additional 8 cursed energy to grant it one of the following benefits, depending on the beast:

### Dire Kaichi
You summon a stronger version of Kaichi. Dire Kaichi deals 4d12 piercing damage plus 4d12 lightning damage on a hit. Its damage is doubled against objects and structures. Dire Kaichi is resistant to all damage types except psychic. Dire Kaichi's hit points are equal to your Charisma score multiplied by four. Additionally, if Dire Kaichi becomes lodged in a creature, the target is considered restrained. Dire Kaichi's damage increases to 7d12 at 17th level and 11d12 at 20th level.

### Dire Reiki
You fully realize the potential of Reiki. Dire Reiki allows you to move through difficult terrain without penalties. You gain advantage on all Dexterity saving throws while Dire Reiki is active. When summoning Dire Reiki, you may move up to your speed as part of the same action.

### Dire Kirin
You allow Kirin to completely take over and reinforce your body. You gain advantage on all Constitution saving throws while Dire Kirin is active. You also ignore any levels of exhaustion you currently have. You reduce all non-Psychic, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage by three times your Charisma modifier. Additionally, you gain a damage threshold equal to your Jujutsu Sorcerer level.

### Dire Ryu
Ryu evolves to its fullest potential, becoming a truly deadly force. While Dire Ryu is active, your unarmed strike tier increases by four.

## Level 20: Dragon Force (Technique Improvement)
You have mastered the fourth beast, Ryu, to its fullest potential. 

Your bludgeoning damage now overcomes resistances, though not immunities. 

Additionally, when you attack using Ryu, you can spend 5 more cursed energy to deal an extra 5d10 bludgeoning damage and force the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target becomes stunned until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, the target is not stunned.

## Technique Reversal: Inauspicious Beast Banish
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

After mastering Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked your cursed technique reversal. You now have the ability to remove other people's summons. 

As an action or reaction, you can spend 6 cursed energy to force all summoners of any shikigami, curses, familiars, or other summoned entities within 20 meters to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, their summons are sent back to their origin. On a success, nothing happens.
