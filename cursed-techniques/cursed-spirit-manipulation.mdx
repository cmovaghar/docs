As a user of the Cursed Spirit Manipulation, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

<Note>
	If you're not in a Jujutsu campaign, you may ask your DM if you have permission to absorb non-humanoid creatures instead of cursed spirits.
</Note>

## Level 1: Cursed Spirit Absorption (Lapse Technique)
You know the taste that no one else will ever know—the taste of curses. As an action or reaction, for 1 Cursed Energy, you may manipulate a cursed spirit within 20 meters of you that has a number of hit points equal to or less than your Charisma modifier multiplied by your proficiency bonus, or any creature whose CR is equal to or lower than your proficiency bonus. You can transform its soul into a small black orb for you to consume. If the creature's CR is equal to or lower than your proficiency bonus, you may ignore the hit point condition and absorb it regardless. Afterward, you can eat the orb, absorbing the creature, and summoning it as an ally to fight for you later. A cursed spirit reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage is exorcised and can no longer be absorbed this way.

You can only consume orbs without physical detriment if the creature consumed has a CR equal to or lower than your Jujutsu Sorcerer level. If the creature's CR exceeds your level, you must roll a Constitution Saving Throw with a DC equal to 5 + the creature's CR. On a successful save, you absorb the creature and can use it after a short or long rest. On a failed save, you gain 2 levels of exhaustion and take necrotic damage equal to the creature's CR (Xd12, with X being the creature's CR). You do not need to make this saving throw if the curse is 2 or more grades lower than your sorcerer level. For example, absorbing a semi-grade 1 curse does not require a save if you are special grade, nor does absorbing a grade 2 curse if you are grade 1 (both instances having a 2-grade gap, including semi-grade 1).

You cannot absorb spirits that belong to other creatures, such as bound spirits or spirits with a master, unless the master dies first. You can have as many cursed spirits as you want, but for every 10 cursed spirits you consume, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you suffer no aftereffects. On a failure, you gain short-term madness if you fail by 4 or less, long-term madness if you fail by 5 or more, and indefinite madness if you fail by 10 or more.

Each absorbed creature gains the following attributes:

- They become immune to being frightened or charmed.
- They lose their free will and follow each and every command you give them.
- If they are reduced to 0 hit points, they die instantly and cannot be revived by any means.
- The creature gains the Cursed Spirits Invisible Force, Undead Nature, and Cursed Nature racial traits.
- Creatures that are not summoned count as taking a long rest when you take a long rest.
- Once absorbed, a creature’s progression stops, and they cannot grow in power in any way, unable to progress in level, CR, or any other facets of progression.

Even if they are far from you, you'll know if your cursed spirits were exorcised.

### Controlling Cursed Spirits

You can summon your cursed spirits as an action by spending an amount of Cursed Energy equal to their CR (minimum of 1), summoning a number of them up to your Charisma modifier within 10 meters of you. To control and command your spirits, follow the Summon Commanding Rules. At 10th level, you gain access to additional Reactions for desummoning curses.

The number of cursed spirits you can summon and control depends on their Grades.

Additionally, when you summon too many cursed spirits, you struggle to manage them individually, forcing you to control them as a group. This reduces their individual strengths but allows for easier management of larger numbers. When you summon 10 or more cursed spirits of the same grade at once, you can combine them into a swarm, as shown in the table. A swarm counts as a single cursed spirit for the purposes of commanding. If you wish to use one cursed spirit from a swarm individually, you can control it by spending an Action or Bonus Action as normal. You can have multiple swarms at once, but each spirit in every swarm still counts toward your summoning limit.

|Cursed Spirit Grade|Number you may have summoned at once|Swarm of Curses|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Grade 4|(Your Jujutsu Sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus) x 3|[Swarm of Grade 4 Cursed Spirits](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Swarm_of_Grade_4_Cursed_Spirits_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)#Swarm_of_Grade_4_Cursed_Spirits)|
|Grade 3|(Your Jujutsu Sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) x 3|[Swarm of Grade 3 Cursed Spirits](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Swarm_of_Grade_3_Cursed_Spirits_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|
|Semi-Grade 2|Your Jujutsu Sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier added twice + your proficiency bonus added twice|[Swarm of Semi-Grade 2 Cursed Spirits](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Swarm_of_Semi-Grade_2_Cursed_Spirits_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|
|Grade 2|Your Jujutsu Sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier added twice|[Swarm of Grade 2 Cursed Spirits](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Swarm_of_Grade_2_Cursed_Spirits_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|
|Semi-Grade 1|Your Jujutsu Sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier|[Swarm of Semi-Grade 1 Cursed Spirits](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Swarm_of_Semi-Grade_1_Cursed_Spirits_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement))|
|Grade 1|Half your Jujutsu Sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier|None|
|Special Grade|Your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus|None| 

If you die, all the cursed spirits you have absorbed are set free, as if they all underwent Cursed Spirit Release.

***Smokescreen.*** At 5th level, you have learned that desummoning your spirits has its advantages. Whenever a spirit in your line of sight dies, you may spend a reaction and 5 cursed energy for the spirit to burst into a cloud of smoke. The area becomes heavily obscured, with its range being 3 meters plus 30 cm for every grade above Grade 4. This effect lasts until the end of the current turn. You may also use this when you are targeted by an attack and a spirit is within 1 meter of you, causing a 1-meter cube originating from you to become heavily obscured until the end of the current turn. At 10th level, you can use the additional reactions granted by Cursed Spirit Battle General for Smokescreen.

***Cursed Spirit Release.*** At 11th level, you gain the ability to release cursed spirits from your curse manipulation. At the end of a long rest, you may release one spirit from your control, restoring their free will and removing the features of an absorbed spirit.

## Level 3: Cursed Infused Spirits (Technique Improvement)
Your cursed energy is continuously infused into your spirits. When summoning a cursed spirit, you may spend Cursed Energy up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to increase the potency of your summoned spirits. The cursed spirit will gain two of the following benefits of your choice for 1 minute:

- A bonus to attack rolls equal to half of the energy spent (rounded down).
- A bonus to damage rolls equal to half of the energy spent (rounded down).
- An additional 1 meter of movement speed per energy spent.
- Any DCs they have are increased by an amount equal to half the energy spent (rounded down).

You may apply these benefits to any number of summoned creatures at once, but you must still apply them individually to each summoned creature.

Additionally, as a reaction, for x Cursed Energy, when you take damage from a source you can see, you may summon a Cursed Spirit to absorb the damage for you. The damage is reduced by the Cursed Spirit's current hit points, with x equal to the CR of the summoned creature. Once the damage is absorbed, the Cursed Spirit is instantly dismissed. If the Cursed Spirit is reduced to 0 hit points, any remaining damage is transferred to you, and the Cursed Spirit instantly dies.

***Curse Reinforced Spirits.*** At 11th level, you gain the ability to enhance a spirit's tenacity by infusing it with your cursed energy when summoning it. As part of summoning a cursed spirit, you may spend Cursed Energy up to twice your Charisma modifier to enhance the spirit, granting it one of the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Their Strength score and its maximum are increased by half the amount spent.
- Their Dexterity score and its maximum are increased by half the amount spent.
- Their Constitution score and its maximum are increased by half the amount spent. If this results in a higher hit point maximum, the additional hit points are added as temporary hit points when the spirit is summoned.
- They gain damage reduction equal to the amount spent.

You may apply these benefits to any number of summoned creatures at once, but you must still apply them individually to each summoned creature.

***Swarms Infuser.*** At 17th level, you learn to infuse your swarms with devastating raw power. You can now apply the benefits of Curse Infused Spirits and Curse Reinforced Spirits to a swarm when summoning it. A swarm counts as one creature for the purpose of infusing it with your cursed energy.

## Level 6: Perfect Spirit Control (Technique Improvement)
You have become highly skilled with your cursed technique, granting you perfect control over your spirits. You gain the following benefits:

- The DC for Wisdom saving throws you make due to cursed spirits is increased to 20.
- The Cursed Energy cost for your spirits is reduced by your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 Cursed Energy).
- The DC for consuming cursed spirits with a CR higher than your level is decreased by your Charisma modifier.
- You can now summon cursed spirits as a bonus action.
- The number of cursed spirits you can summon with a single action is now your Charisma modifier added twice. At 10th level, this increases to your Charisma modifier added three times, and at 14th level, it increases to your Charisma modifier added four times.
- When you summon a cursed spirit, you can give it a command as part of the same action. The command can be simple or complex, depending on the action you used (e.g., a complex command with an action and a simple command with a bonus action).
- When you summon a Grade 4 cursed spirit, you may summon additional ones up to your Charisma modifier for the same Cursed Energy cost as the first one, provided all have an equal or lesser cost. At 10th level, this increases to your Charisma modifier added twice. At 14th level, you may also apply this to Grade 3 cursed spirits.

## Level 10: Cursed Spirit Battle General (Technique Improvement)
You have become the ultimate battle master of your cursed spirits, seamlessly integrating them into your combat style. 

You can now summon cursed spirits as a reaction when targeted by a weapon attack, spell, melee cursed energy attack roll, ranged cursed energy attack roll, or any saving throws from sources outside your body. You gain additional reactions equal to your Charisma modifier, which can only be used to summon your cursed spirits, reduce damage, or command them to take their own reaction. When summoning a cursed spirit as a reaction, you can immediately command them to perform a reaction if they have one, without expending another reaction. They will take their reaction as if they were being targeted by the same effect that originally targeted you.

Alternatively, you can command them to take one action or bonus action, during which they can only make a single attack, cast one spell, use one ability, or perform one technique. They cannot use Domain Expansions, even if they have one.

Additionally, when you use your Martial Arts to make an extra unarmed strike or one-handed weapon attack as a bonus action, you can command all your cursed spirits within 3 meters of you to also make one melee weapon attack as part of the same action. When using your Cursed Blast of Blows, you can instead command them to take their full Attack Action.

This feature only applies to abilities that physically travel and can be stopped. Abilities that do not physically travel, such as eye contact, mind control, basilisk stare, or telekinetic explosions, are not affected by Cursed Spirit Battle General.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Minimum Uzumaki (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have discovered how to fuse two cursed spirits into a deadly spiral. As a bonus action, you can spend two cursed spirits to create a miniature spiral that fits in your hand. The spiral remains invisible to creatures until one of them spends an action to make a DC 25 Perception check.

As an action or reaction to being targeted by a melee attack, for 5 Cursed Energy, you can release all the condensed energy from this Uzumaki into a creature. Make a melee cursed energy attack roll against one of their limbs (except for the torso, jaw, or skull). On a hit, the target takes Xd12 necrotic damage, where 'X' is the combined challenge rating of the two curses. This damage ignores resistance and treats immunity as resistance. On a critical hit, the target must make a Constitution saving throw against your Cursed Energy DC. On a failure, they lose the targeted limb.

You have advantage on your attack roll if the target has not detected your Minimum Uzumaki.

Both of the cursed spirits used in the Uzumaki are spent and cannot be used again. However, you may choose to acquire any cursed techniques or spellcasting abilities they had. The Cursed Energy cost for spells is their level times two, while cursed techniques cost as much as they would for the curse. You can have up to three cursed techniques or spellcasting abilities before needing to forget one to gain another. After the first use of a spellcasting ability or cursed technique, you lose that feature and gain a free technique slot.

## Level 20: Maximum Uzumaki (Maximum Technique)
Your mastery of Cursed Spirit Manipulation has allowed you to reach a new pinnacle of jujutsu sorcery and develop a Maximum Technique. While Uzumaki is primarily used for recycling weaker spirits, if a spirit with a cursed technique is placed into Uzumaki, you can extract the technique for yourself.

As an action, for 2 cursed energy per cursed spirit in Uzumaki (up to a maximum of 20 cursed energy), you can create a dark spiral-like pattern with any number of your cursed spirits (minimum of 1) that can be used in an attack. Every creature in a cone extending 30 feet for each cursed spirit used must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 1d12 necrotic damage for each cursed spirit used in Uzumaki. On a success, they take half damage.

A cursed spirit above CR 1 may be treated as an amount of spirits equal to its CR.

This feature treats immunity as resistance and resistance as if you were hitting a creature normally. The number of cursed spirits you can add to your Uzumaki is your Charisma modifier times your proficiency bonus, added twice. The damage dice for Uzumaki cannot exceed 60 before applying outside increases, unless you are above 20th level.

<Note>
	When playing outside a Jujutsu campaign, absorbed creatures other than cursed spirits need to be at least CR 1 to be put into Maximum Uzumaki.
</Note>

All the cursed spirits used in the Uzumaki are spent and cannot be used again. However, you may choose to obtain any cursed techniques or spellcasting abilities they had. The Cursed Energy cost for spells is their level times two, while cursed techniques cost as much as they would for the curse. You can have up to three cursed techniques or spellcasting abilities before needing to forget one to gain another. After the first use of a spellcasting ability or cursed technique, you lose that feature and gain a free technique slot. Both variations of Uzumaki share these three slots.

This technique deals twice as much damage to objects and structures.

## Technique Reversal: Cursed Spirit Annihilation
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

With your mastery of the Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked your reversal: the ability to infuse spirits with positive energy, annihilating them. 

As an action or reaction, for an amount of cursed energy equal to half the spirit's CR (rounded up), you can target a spirit within 60 feet of you with hit points equal to or less than your Charisma modifier times your proficiency bonus, added twice. The spirit must make a Constitution saving throw. 

On a success, they are unaffected. 

On a failure, they are overloaded with positive energy and are killed outright. You may also ignore the conditions if the spirit’s CR is equal to or lower than your proficiency bonus.
