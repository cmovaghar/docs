As a user of the Tool Manipulation, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Tool Manipulation (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to manipulate an object to which you are attuned. When you take a long rest, you can spend 4 hours imbuing cursed energy into a single object that weighs no more than 100 times your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) pounds. Afterward, the object becomes attuned to you. You can attune to a number of objects equal to your Charisma modifier. You can remove your attunement to an object without using an action.

With no action required, if an object you're attuned to is within 3 meters, you can lift it into the air and bring it within 1 meter of you. It will stay within 1 meter of you and follow you until you dismiss it (no action required), grab it, or use a Free Action to control it.

As a Free Action for 1 Cursed Energy, you can telepathically control the object to keep it in the air for 1 minute. While the object is in the air, you can move it up to 25 meters from you. While controlled, you can take one of the following actions:

Attack: You can make a number of ranged cursed energy attack rolls up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1, maximum of 5) against one or more creatures within 6 meters to 25 meters. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 + your Charisma modifier in bludgeoning damage. If the object is a melee weapon, you may replace the damage with the weapon's original damage. After all attacks are made, the object returns to within 1 meter of you and keeps floating by your side. These attacks may count as Cursed Projectiles for the purpose of Black Flash.

Depending on the object's weight, the damage die tier is increased as the impact increases.

|Weight|Die Tier|
|:-:|:-:|
|0.5 kg|d4|
|100 kg|d6|
|200 kg|d8|
|300 kg|d10|
|400 kg|d12|

The damage for this technique increases to 2d4 at 5th level, to 4d4 at 11th level, to 7d4 at 17th level, and to 11d4 at 20th level.

***Mount.*** While the object is within 1 meter of a creature, you can spend half of its movement speed to allow up to two creatures you choose (including yourself) to mount it and use it for flight. While riding the object, it gains a flying speed of 20 times your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You may spend additional cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier to increase the tool’s flying speed by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier times the amount spent for 1 minute. This cannot be performed if the tool is already benefiting from a speed increase. Creatures riding the object take no opportunity attacks while flying past a creature.

If the tool is two or more sizes smaller than the creature riding it, the rider must make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check each time they mount the tool or travel 20 meters. On a failure, the rider falls off the object and becomes prone. If multiple creatures are riding the tool, the flying speed decreases by 6 meters for every size the creature is larger than the tool.

While on top of the tool, you can spend 2 cursed energy as a bonus action to activate a cursed lamp. While the lamp is active, you have advantage on Perception checks to locate creatures. Additionally, you may spend a free action to choose one hostile creature you can see, revealing it to all your allies, making their first attack roll against it have advantage.

This lamp lasts until it’s used to locate a creature.

At 6th level, you can spend up to twice your Charisma modifier to increase the flying speed.

***Utilize.*** You can exert fine control over tools, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or container, storing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

Whenever your tool stops flying, you can spend 1 cursed energy to keep it flying for 1 more minute. You can only utilize one attuned tool at a time, even though you can have multiple attuned tools.

***Protect.*** As a reaction to being targeted by a projectile or melee attack roll, you can call an object within 20 meters of you to protect you. The object grants you an AC bonus depending on its size: +2 AC for Small, increasing by +1 for each size above Small (e.g., +3 for Medium, +4 for Huge, etc.). If this causes the attack to miss, the object takes the damage. If you have additional reactions, you may call additional objects to protect you from the same attack. This cannot grant more than +10 to your AC. You may use this to protect other creatures, but each creature can only be protected by one object.

At 12th level, your maximum number of attuned objects increases to an amount equal to twice your Charisma modifier.

## Level 3: Cursed Gust of Wind (Extension Technique)
You have developed an extension technique that allows you to unleash powerful gusts of wind while flying on your tool. As an action for 2 cursed energy, you create a strong line of wind 20 meters long and 3 meters wide. All creatures within the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take 3d10 slashing damage and are pushed back a distance equal to 10 times your Charisma modifier. On a success, they take half as much damage and are pushed half the distance.

Objects and structures take twice as much damage from this technique, and the affected area is considered difficult terrain until a creature spends 1 minute clearing it.

If a creature or object collides with another object or creature while being pushed, both take 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

The damage of this technique increases to 5d10 at 5th level, 8d10 at 11th level, 12d10 at 17th level, and 17d10 at 20th level.

## Level 6: Wind Scythe (Extension Technique)
You have created your most powerful extension technique, capable of immense destruction. As an action for 8 cursed energy, while flying on your tool, you unleash a powerful gust of wind toward a point within range. Make a ranged cursed energy attack roll against a target within 20 meters. On a hit, the target takes 5d12 slashing damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. You may also choose to affect any creatures or objects within 3 meters of the original target.

The damage of this technique increases to 9d12 at 11th level, 15d12 at 17th level, and 23d12 at 20th level.

## Level 10: The Watcher (Technique Improvement)
You become the perfect watchdog, soaring high and keeping watch over everything below. 

While moving with your flying speed, you add your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to your passive perception, and you cannot be surprised while conscious. 

Additionally, while flying on your tool, ranged attack rolls against you are made with disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws as long as you can see the source of the effect.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - One Man's Army (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned to expand your technique to its absolute maximum. 

As a bonus action for 10 cursed energy, you can activate One Man’s Army for 10 minutes. For the duration, the number of tools you can control at once increases to your Charisma modifier, and whenever you take an action to control one, you may command all of them simultaneously. 

Additionally, you gain a number of reactions equal to your Charisma modifier, which can be used to take the Protect reaction.

When using the attack action with your tools, you can make only one attack per tool.

## Level 20: The One Above All (Technique Improvement)
You are always above all creatures, untouchable, and able to unleash your fury from the skies at will. While flying on your tool, you gain the following benefits:

- Your movement speed is doubled.
- You have advantage on all Dexterity checks and saving throws. If you already have advantage, you roll three dice instead of two.
- You add your proficiency bonus to your AC.
- You make all ranged attack rolls with advantage.

## Technique Reversal: Creature Manipulation
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have discovered your technique reversal, allowing you to control living creatures instead of tools. As an action for 2 cursed energy, you force one creature within 40 meters to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they are charmed by you for 1 minute.

While charmed, you share a telepathic link with the creature as long as you are on the same plane of existence. Through this link, you can issue commands following the Summon Commanding Rules.

Each time the target takes damage, it must make a new Wisdom saving throw against the technique. On a success, the effect ends.

You can control up to two creatures at once. If you have chosen the Tokyo school and are 14th level, you can control a number of creatures equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2).
