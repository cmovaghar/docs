As a user of the Claw Technique, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Claw Formation (Lapse Technique)
You have learned to form your deadly claws. 

As a bonus action, you can activate your claws for 1 cursed energy, causing your unarmed strikes, cursed strikes, and Curse-Empowered Strikes to deal slashing damage for 1 minute. Additionally, when you score a critical hit while your claws are active, you deal an additional die of your unarmed strike damage.

At 3rd level, you deal an additional 2 dice of damage. At 8th level, you deal an additional 3 dice. At 16th level, you deal an additional 4 dice. At 20th level, you deal an additional 5 dice.

## Level 3: Quick Claws (Technique Improvement)
You have become more skilled in the use of your claws. 

You can now activate them as a free action.

## Level 6: Long Claws (Technique Improvement)
You have learned to extend your claws for greater range. 

As part of activating your Lapse technique, you can spend cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier, adding 1 meter to your claw range for each point of cursed energy spent. This increased range lasts for the duration of your claws. 

Additionally, you may use this as a bonus action on your turn while your claws are active. If you use Long Claws a second time during the duration of your Lapse technique, the new range replaces the previous one.

## Level 10: Barbed Claws (Technique Improvement)
Your claws' sharpness increases to a razor-like edge. 

Once per turn, after making a successful attack, you can spend 3 cursed energy to force the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they begin bleeding. On a success, they are unaffected.

Additionally, while your claws are activated, your unarmed strike damage tier increases by half your Charisma modifier (rounded down).

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Claw Utility (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have greatly expanded upon your technique, drawing inspiration from nature. 

While your claws are active, you gain both a climbing speed and burrowing speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you make saving throws to avoid being moved against your will with advantage while your claws are out, as you dig into the ground for stability.

Furthermore, as a reaction to being hit by a melee weapon attack, you can attempt to block it with your claws, increasing your Armor Class by your proficiency bonus for that triggering attack.

## Level 20: Ultimate Claws (Technique Improvement)
You have reached the apex of your technique, with claws that can cut through virtually anything. 

Slashing damage dealt by your claws now ignores resistance and treats immunity as resistance. 

Additionally, if you roll a 1 or 2 on damage dice for slashing damage dealt by your claws, you may reroll that die and must use the new result, even if it is a 1 or 2.

Furthermore, your critical hit range when using your claws is now from 18 to 20.

## Technique Reversal: Claw Deformation
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have now mastered Reverse Cursed Technique and unlocked your cursed technique reversal. Normally, you use your innate technique to form claws on your hands, but with your reversal, you can instead dull your hands, making them very smooth. 

As a bonus action, for 2 cursed energy, you can activate this new technique for 1 minute. While active, your unarmed strikes deal their normal damage in bludgeoning, and you gain a reaction.

This reaction can be used when you are targeted by a melee attack roll. You must make a melee attack roll in response to the incoming attack roll. If your roll exceeds the creature's, the attack glances off your smooth hands and misses.
