As a user of Limitless, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Infinity (Lapse Technique)
You gain the ability to manipulate space to better protect yourself. As an action, you can spend 3 Cursed Energy to cause the space around you to fracture into infinite divisions for 1 minute. 

Whenever you are targeted by a weapon, spell, melee cursed energy attack roll, ranged cursed energy attack roll, or any saving throws from sources outside your body, you may use your reaction to spend 1 Cursed Energy and roll a d20. On a roll of 11 or higher, any attacks or spells made against you automatically fail to hit or harm you in any physical way. 

At 6th level, you must roll a 7 or higher, and at 10th level, you must roll a 4 or higher. 

Additionally, you gain a number of extra reactions equal to your Charisma modifier plus your proficiency bonus, which can only be used for this feature. You can also activate this ability as a reaction to being targeted by an attack or effect that would cause you damage, provided you can see it.

When you take the *Dodge* action while *Infinity* is activated, you can use your *Infinity* reactions to protect a number of creatures within your reach equal to the number of arms you have with *Infinity*, in addition to yourself. 

Regardless of your level, this feature only works on things that physically travel and can be stopped. Abilities that do not involve physical movement will not be affected by *Infinity*. For example, eye contact, mind control, basilisk stare, or causing things to explode with your mind are not stopped by *Infinity*.

***Spatial Cursed Energy.*** Due to your innate technique, you have developed a strong affinity for space. When you activate your *Cursed Armor Enhancement*, you gain resistance to force damage. Additionally, when you deal damage with your *Curse-Empowered Strikes*, cursed strikes, or the *Cursed Weapon Enhancement* feature, you can choose to change the damage type to Force damage.

## Level 3: Blue (Lapse Technique)
As an amplification of Limitless, you can directly manipulate space. As an action, you can spend 5 cursed energy to erase space within a 10-meter range, creating a blue sphere with a 2-meter radius that pulls everything toward its center for 1 minute. All creatures within this area must make a Strength saving throw. 

On a failed save, they take 6d8 Force damage, are Restrained until the beginning of their next turn, and are pulled to the nearest open space toward the center of the sphere. On a successful save, they take half damage and are neither restrained nor pulled. 

A creature can attempt this saving throw again at the start of each of their turns. On a success, they take half the damage and exit the sphere. On a failure, they remain within the sphere and take damage again. 

Any creatures that enter the sphere's range must also make the Strength saving throw. You can dispel this technique as a free action.

At 5th level, this technique’s damage increases to 7d8. At 11th level, it increases to 9d8, at 17th level to 12d8, and at 20th level to 16d8. Objects within the area that aren’t being worn or carried also take this damage.

At 13th level, when you use your blue technique in its Maximum Output form, you can spend a bonus action to move the sphere anywhere within 10 meters of its original location. All creatures currently within the sphere will be moved as well, and any creatures caught within the sphere’s new range must make the saving throw again.

Whenever a projectile, ranged attack roll, or spell/technique with a line area passes through *Blue*’s area of effect, it is drawn to the center of the sphere. If the technique or attack would deal less damage than *Blue*, it is pulled in and completely stopped—missing its target in the case of an attack and being cut short in the case of a line effect. If it is a projectile, it also takes *Blue*’s damage. In the case of a line effect, its trajectory is altered, with the effect’s area starting at the first point where it entered *Blue*’s area and ending at the center of the sphere. Any creatures in this new area are affected by the line effect as usual. If the attack or line effect would deal more damage than *Blue*, it ignores *Blue*’s effect and proceeds as normal, but its damage is reduced by *Blue*’s damage.

## Level 5: Infinity Pressure (Improved Technique)
You have learned to imbue more cursed energy into your *Infinity*, making it more powerful. As a bonus action, while *Infinity* is active or when you activate it, you can spend cursed energy up to half your level (rounded up) to increase its density and force.

Every creature that starts its turn within 1 meter of you must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed back 1 meter and knocked prone. If a creature is knocked against a stone wall or into a solid surface (consult your DM), their saving throw is made to avoid taking 1d12 force damage for every cursed energy spent, as well as being restrained, as they are crushed against the wall. For each point of damage the creature suffers, the object or wall behind them takes the same amount of damage on a failed save. You must spend a number of cursed energy equal to the amount used for activation at the start of your turn to maintain this form of *Infinity*.

While *Infinity Pressure* is active, your movement speed is reduced to 2 meters, and you cannot make melee attack rolls.

Additionally, if a creature is using *Domain Amplification* to negate *Infinity*, *Infinity* will not be nullified if you have spent more cursed energy on *Infinity Pressure* than they have on *Domain Amplification*. You can use *Infinity Pressure* as a reaction when a creature hits you with a melee attack while their *Domain Amplification* is active.

## Level 5: Blue Manipulation (Improved Technique)
You have learned to use *Blue* to manipulate space with greater precision. As an action, you can spend 10 cursed energy to cast *Telekinesis* using your *Blue*. Any enhancements applied to *Blue*, except those that increase your damage dice, also affect this ability (including range increases and cursed energy cost reductions). The distance you can move anything you've grabbed with this telekinetic force is equal to your base movement speed.

If you have *Simultaneous Casting*, you can cast this ability a number of additional times equal to your Charisma modifier to target more items or to target the same item multiple times. This allows you to double the weight limit per stack when focusing on a single object, or to impose multiple Strength saving throws on the same target if they continue to escape.

If you attempt to throw an object at someone within its range, you can treat the object as if it is under the effects of the *Animate Object* spell, dealing damage appropriate to its size. Additionally, objects you manipulate that normally lack stat blocks can use these stat blocks if they are attacked. For the purpose of commanding gargantuan objects (which would normally be impossible with *Animate Objects*), you can refer to this stat block.

---

### Gargantuan Object (Blue Manipulation)
*Gargantuan Object*

- **Armor Class** 8
- **Hit Points**  120
- **Strength** 22 (+6)
- **Dexterity** 4 (-3)

***Throw Attack.*** The creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d12 + 6 bludgeoning damage and half as much on a success.

---

If you attempt to throw a person at another person or object, they will be treated as a medium object regardless of their size, and the damage dealt will be reflected back onto them.

Additionally, for every meter an object travels while closing the distance to its target, it gains an additional d4 of damage, up to a maximum of 24d4.

This ability can also be used outside of combat to freely manipulate tiny objects at no cost.

## Level 6: Teleport Technique (Extension Technique)
You have learned to manipulate the space-time around you, allowing you to bend it to your will. When you take the movement action, you can spend 1 cursed energy to teleport to your destination, preventing attacks of opportunity. The first attack roll you make after teleporting is made with advantage, unless the target’s passive Perception is higher than your cursed energy DC. When using this feature, there must be an unobstructed path to your desired teleportation destination, even if it is a path you could not normally traverse.

Additionally, as a reaction, by spending 5 cursed energy when you are targeted by an attack, spell, melee cursed energy attack roll, ranged cursed energy attack roll, or any saving throw, you can teleport to an empty space within a distance equal to your movement speed. This causes the attack or effect to miss if you move out of its range or area. You can only use one of these teleport features per round.

Finally, when you move, you can spend 6 cursed energy to use *Blue* to propel yourself into the air, granting you a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute. After this minute ends, you can spend 1 additional cursed energy to extend this effect for another minute, and so on. You can also grant this flying speed to other creatures you are sharing *Infinity* with or that you are currently holding.

## Level 10: Blue Infused Strikes (Extension Technique)
You have learned to imbue *Blue* into your strikes. Whenever you hit with an unarmed strike, you can spend up to 6 cursed energy to deal an additional 1d8 force damage per energy spent. 

This damage cannot be increased by features from the *Tokyo School*.

## Level 11: Space Manipulation
Through constant practice with your teleportation technique, you have mastered the ability to travel long distances. 

You can now cast the *Teleport* spell as an action by spending 10 cursed energy, using your teleportation technique. Instead of requiring the destination to be on the same plane of existence, it must be within a number of kilometers equal to 10 times your Jujutsu Sorcerer level.

If you have the *Six Eyes* background feat, you always arrive at the exact location you intend, and the range is extended to anywhere on the same planet.

## Level 11: Blue Augmented Speed
You learn to manipulate the space around you by utilizing *Blue* to increase your speed. 

As a bonus action, you can spend cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier to increase your movement speed by 2 meters per cursed energy spent. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

## Level 11: Semi-Perfect Infinity
You've almost perfected your *Infinity*. It now works against poisons.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Delayed Explosions
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have mastered the ability to delay your Innate Technique, creating surprise explosions. 

Whenever you use your Blue (or Red if you have the reversal) technique, you may reduce its size and suppress its explosion, delaying its activation. All hostile creatures must make a Perception check against your Cursed Energy DC. 

Any features that raise the delayed technique's DC or impose disadvantage on targeted creatures also apply to this check.

- On a failure, creatures fail to notice the delayed technique and believe it has already exploded, vanished, or missed. You may choose to activate the technique as normal initially and then transition it into its delayed state. If you choose this with Blue, it loses its lingering effect.
- Movement: While delayed, you can move the technique during your turn (no action required), up to your movement speed through the air.
- Duration: A delayed technique remains in this state for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).
- Activation: As a bonus action, you may detonate the delayed technique. When detonated, the technique's effect range doubles, and affected creatures automatically fail their saving throws, ignoring features like Evasion. If a creature succeeds on the initial Perception check, they may make their saving throw as normal.

***Explosive Purple.*** If you detonate a delayed *Red* and *Blue* technique simultaneously while they are within range of one another, a massive *Purple* is formed, erasing everything in its wake. All creatures within a 60-meter radius centered on the point of explosion must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 50d12 force damage. If they fail by 5 or more, the damage ignores features like Endurance. On a success, they take half as much damage.

Objects within the area that aren’t worn or carried also take this damage. Any creature or object reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated, killed outright.

Explosive Purple counts as an Innate Technique feature for the purposes of other enhancements.

At 17th level, this damage increases to 56d12, and at 20th level to 60d12.

## Level 17: Perfect Infinity
You've reached the pinnacle of *Infinity*. When you activate *Infinity*, you may spend an additional 6 cursed energy to automatically roll a 20.

## Level 20: Simultaneous Casting (Extension Casting)
You have mastered advanced control over Blue. When you cast *Blue*, you can pay its cost additional times, up to half your Charisma modifier (rounded down). For each additional cost paid, you create an extra Blue within 1 meter of the original. These additional *Blues* deal the same damage as the original but do not restrain their targets.

Alternatively, you may shoot the additional *Blues* as projectiles, following the rules for cursed projectiles. These projectiles deal *Blue*'s damage and can replace any number of attacks you make on your turn.

You cannot apply *Delayed Explosions*, *Maximum Output*, *Chanting*, or any damage-increasing features or effects—including those from *Domain Expansions* or *Tokyo School*—to a *Blue* cast in this way.

## Technique Reversal: Red
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have learned to invert Limitless using Reverse Cursed Technique, creating a devastating blast that expands space.

As an action and by spending 10 Cursed Energy, choose a point within 12 meters. All creatures within a radius of your choice (from 1 to 10 meters) centered on that point must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is knocked back 30 meters, takes 16d8 force damage, and is knocked prone. On a success, the creature takes half damage and is neither knocked back nor prone.

Alternatively, you may make a ranged cursed energy attack roll against a creature within 36 meters, targeting them with a more precise version of *Red*. This version has the same effects, with the explosion’s center being the targeted creature.

This technique deals double damage to objects and structures. Objects within the explosion’s radius that aren’t being worn or carried also take this damage.

At 17th level, the damage increases to 24d8, and at 20th level, it increases further to 32d8.

***Prefected Red***. At 20th level, you have mastered the ability to grant *Simultaneous Casting* benefits to your *Red*. *Red* cast this way does not push creatures or knock them prone. You cannot use *Delayed Explosions*, *Maximum Output*, *Chanting*, or any damage-increasing features or effects on a *Red* cast this way. This includes enhancements from *Domain Expansions* or *Tokyo School* features.
