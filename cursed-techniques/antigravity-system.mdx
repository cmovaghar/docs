As a user of the Antigravity System, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Antigravitational Energy
Your antigravity constantly affects your system. 

Whenever you use a cursed energy feature that deals damage, you may change its damage type to force damage instead. 

Additionally, you gain resistance to force damage while under the effects of Cursed Armor.

## Level 1: Antigravity System (Lapse Technique)
You have begun to learn the basic aspects of your technique, allowing you to create a small gravitational field around yourself. 

As an action, for 3 cursed energy, you can reverse gravity in a 3-meter-radius, 10-meter-high cylinder centered on you for all creatures except yourself until the beginning of your next turn.

All creatures and objects not anchored to the ground within the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you use this technique. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object within reach, avoiding the fall. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered during the fall, the falling creatures and objects strike it as they would in a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.

At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down. Additionally, fall damage from this technique ignores any fall damage negation, reduction, or immunity.

At 5th level, the cylinder's height increases to 15 meters, rising to 30 meters at 11th level, 45 meters at 17th level, and 60 meters at 20th level.

***Nauseating Gravity.*** At 5th level, when you raise creatures into the air, they feel as if their bodies are turning inside out. Whenever a creature is affected by your technique, they must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are [Confused](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Confused) until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, they are not Confused.

***Incapacitating Gravity.*** At 11th level, those affected by your technique are so disoriented by the situation that they can’t act properly. If a creature fails the Constitution saving throw by 5 or more, in addition to the other effects, if they take an Action or a bonus action on their turn, they must roll a d4. On a result of 1-2, they can’t take a bonus action or an action on that turn.

***Fast Gravity.*** At 17th level, the activation of your technique is so fast that it's very difficult to avoid. Creatures with a Dexterity score lower than your cursed energy DC must make their saving throw with disadvantage.

## Level 3: Antigravity Focus (Extension Technique)
You have created an extension technique to prevent all creatures from being affected at once by your antigravity system. 

As a bonus action after using the antigravity system, you can spend 4 cursed energy to choose a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) + your proficiency bonus to not be affected by your antigravity system.

***Anti Gravity Flight.*** At 5th level, you have enhanced your control over your Innate Technique, allowing you to affect only yourself. As a bonus action, for 6 cursed energy, you touch a willing creature, granting them a flying speed equal to their movement speed for 10 minutes. You may end this effect at will.

## Level 6: Hard Fall (Technique Improvement)
Your technique evolves, now causing your victims to be launched at high speeds toward their demise. 

Whenever a creature takes fall damage from your Innate Technique, they take 1d8 per 3 meters fallen instead of 1d6.

At 11th level, creatures now take 1d10 per 3 meters fallen. This increases to 1d12 per  meters at 17th level. Finally, at 20th level, creatures take damage per 1 meter fallen instead of 10.

## Level 10: Long Inverted Gravity (Technique Improvement)
Your technique now lasts much longer than before. 

Whenever you activate your Antigravity System, it lasts for 1 minute instead of until the beginning of your next turn. You can end the technique at will.

Whenever your technique is about to end, you can spend 1 cursed energy to extend its duration by 1 additional minute.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Boosted Systems (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

In Tokyo, you have developed a new method to boost the output of an already existing system. 

As a bonus action while your Antigravity System is active, you can spend 3 additional cursed energy to enhance it. When boosting it, creatures who passed the saving throw the first time are forced to make the Dexterity saving throw again, suffering the effects of your Antigravity System on a failure. Creatures who fail the first save fall upward an additional amount of meters equal to the height of your lapse.

If you have your Cursed Technique Reversal, you can also use this on a Gravity System. As a bonus action while the Gravity System is active, you may spend 6 additional cursed energy to boost it. This forces creatures to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take damage equal to half the damage dice (rounded up) of your Gravity System. On a success, they take a quarter of the damage dice (rounded up) of your Gravity System.

## Level 20: Levitational Apex (Extension Technique)
You have created an extension technique that allows you to generate a larger Antigravity System capable of making objects float. 

As an action, for 12 cursed energy, you can create an Antigravity System with a radius of 15 meters and a height of 60 meters. This system lasts for 1 minute, and you must maintain concentration for its duration. Creatures caught in this Antigravity System act as if they were caught inside your lapse. However, this system starts below your feet, pulling the ground up from beneath you. The ground within the radius of this feature floats with you for the duration.

As a bonus action, while this system is active, you can move in a direction of your choice up to your unarmored movement speed. When the system ends, creatures below must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d12 per 10 feet the ground fell before hitting the ground. On a success, creatures take half damage.

## Technique Reversal: Gravity System
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have learned how to reverse your own technique, manifesting a field of intense gravity. 

As an action, for 6 cursed energy, you force every creature within a 3-meter radius of you to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take 10d10 force damage and are knocked prone and restrained until the beginning of your next turn or until they leave the area. Their melee attack rolls will automatically fail. On a success, they take half as much damage and are not prone or restrained, but their melee attack rolls are made with disadvantage.

This technique deals twice as much damage to objects and structures.

You can also use this technique as a reaction to an attack being made against you or if you're forced to make a saving throw. If used against a saving throw, you reduce the damage of the saving throw by the damage of your Gravity System. If you reduce the damage to 0, the effect ends. Any remaining damage after being reduced is transferred to you. This only works on physical saves or things affected by gravity.

Ranged attacks made inside the Gravity System, or whose projectiles enter it, will fail if the roll is lower than your cursed energy DC added twice.

If a Dexterity or Constitution saving throw targets a creature inside the Gravity System, its total damage will be reduced by your Gravity System damage die. This does not work in the case of the attack dealing thunder or psychic damage.

This technique's damage increases to 15d10 at 11th level, 20d10 at 17th level, and 25d10 at 20th level.

***Perfect Gravity.*** At 17th level, your gravity reaches its peak, completely destroying your opponents on contact. If your opponent's Strength score is equal to or smaller than your cursed energy DC, they have disadvantage on the saving throw. Additionally, if they fail the saving throw by 5 or more, they gain one level of exhaustion. Furthermore, while a creature is restrained, they now automatically fail Dexterity saving throws.
