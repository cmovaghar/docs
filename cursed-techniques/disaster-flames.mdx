As a user of the Disaster Flames, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Burning Cursed Energy
Your Cursed Energy is fueled by flames, granting you resistance to Fire damage when you activate your Cursed Energy Armor. Additionally, when you deal damage with the *Curse-Empowered Strikes* or *Cursed Energy Ray* features, you can change the damage type to fire damage.

***Purple Flames.*** Your flames burn brighter when unleashed at full power. Each time you use a feature granted by this Innate Technique, you gain 1 point of Purple Flames. You can accumulate a number of Purple Flames points equal to your proficiency bonus, and any unused points are lost at the end of a short or long rest.

***Continuous Flames.*** At 11th level, your flames continue to burn your targets after they’re struck. Whenever a creature is hit or fails a saving throw against taking damage from the purple version of your Innate Technique, they are engulfed in flames, taking additional Fire damage equal to your Charisma score (minimum of 10).

## Level 1: Disaster Flames (Lapse Technique)
You can create basic, fiery blasts. When you take the Attack action, you can spend a number of Cursed Energy up to half your Charisma modifier (rounded down, minimum of 1) to replace one of your attacks with either a melee or ranged Cursed Energy attack roll against a creature within 30 meters of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage per Cursed Energy spent and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they suffer First Degree burns. On a success, they gain no additional condition. If they fail by 5 or more, they suffer Second Degree burns.

Additionally, all creatures of your choice within a 10-foot cone behind the target are also affected.

You can replace multiple attacks with Disaster Flames, but you must spend the corresponding Cursed Energy for each attack. This cannot replace attacks from features like *Cursed Blast of Blows*.

At 5th level, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier when using Disaster Flames. At 11th level, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier + half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down). At 17th level, you can spend up to twice your Charisma modifier. At 20th level, you can spend up to thrice your Charisma modifier. 

***Purple Hands.*** You can spend 2 purple flame points to increase the damage die by one tier (2d8 -> 2d10). Additionally, if the target fails the Constitution saving throw, they receive Second Degree burns. If they fail by 5 or more, they receive Third Degree burns. The cone is also increased to 10 meters. 

## Level 3: Erupting Volcanoes (Extension Technique)
With a deeper understanding of the flames you wield, you can now create magma volcanoes.

As an action, you can create a number of volcanoes up to your Charisma modifier on any surface within 36 meters of you. Each volcano occupies a 1-meter radius circle and lasts until the beginning of your next turn. Each volcano costs 1 Cursed Energy to create.

***Magma Basts.*** As part of the same action with which you create the volcanoes, you can force every creature in a 10-meter long, 2-meter wide line originating from each volcano to make a Dexterity saving throw as the volcanoes erupt. On a failure, they take 2d10 Fire damage, become restrained by the magma for 1 minute, and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, they take half damage and are not restrained.

Alternatively, you can choose to delay the eruption of the volcanoes. In this case, the volcanoes do not fire immediately but instead erupt as a reaction when a creature enters the area of effect that the Magma Blast would occupy. If they fail the saving throw, they also suffer *Second Degree Burns* and if they fail by 5 or more, they suffer *Third Degree Burns*.

The creature can make a Strength saving throw at the beginning of its turns, ending the restrained condition early on a success.

Any area targeted by this feature becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute, and any creature that ends its turn on it takes 2d10 Fire damage.

This technique’s damage increases as you gain level: 4d10 at 5th level, 7d10 at 11th level, 11d10 at 17th level, and 16d10 at 20th level.

Creatures within the area of effect of multiple volcanoes make only one saving throw and take the damage from just one volcano, but the DC of the saving throw increases by 1 for each volcano affecting the creature.

***Purple Volcanoes.*** When you use this technique, you can spend 2 Purple Flame points to increase the range of the Magma Blast to 20 meters and its width to 4 meters. Additionally, creatures have disadvantage on the Dexterity saving throw caused by the Magma Blast.

## Level 6: Ember Insects (Extension Technique)
You have learned to create small insect Shikigami.

As an action, you can spend an amount of Cursed Energy up to your Charisma modifier to summon an equal number of Ember Insects within 2 meters of you. These insects remain for 1 minute.

***Purple Insects.*** When you use this technique, you can spend 3 Purple Flame points to enhance your Ember Insects. They gain a +2 bonus to all ability scores, and their explosion damage increases to 8d4.

#### Traits
***Invisible Force.*** This creature is entirely made out of cursed energy, meaning it cannot be seen by normal people. Creatures without levels in the Jujutsu Sorcerer class or who cannot see into the ethereal plane cannot see it. Although, if these creatures were in a life and death situation (less than half their maximum hit points), they gain the ability to see it. 

***Short Life.*** Once an Ember Insect hits a creature with its *Sting* attack, its master can choose to detonate it immediately, or it will explode upon being reduced to 0 hit points. When an Ember Insect explodes, all creatures within a 1-meter radius must make a Dexterity saving throw against the master’s Cursed Energy DC. On a failure, they take 4d4 fire damage and are blinded until the beginning of the master’s next turn. On a success, they take half damage and are not blinded.

#### Actions
***Sting.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +4, reach 1 m. *Hit* 4 (1d4 + 2) Piercing damage.

## Level 10: Molten Comet (Extension Technique)
You create a massive rock of solidified magma and hurl it at your foes.

As an action, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to choose a point within 20 meters. All creatures in a 2-meter square centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 5d10 fire damage and 5d10 bludgeoning damage, and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half damage and are not knocked prone. This technique deals double damage to objects and structures, and any objects in the area take maximum damage. The affected area becomes difficult terrain.

The damage increases as you gain levels: 8d10 Fire + 8d10 Bludgeoning at 11th level, 12d10 Fire + 12d10 Bludgeoning at 17th level, and 17d10 Fire + 17d10 Bludgeoning at 20th level.

***Purple Comet.*** When you use this technique, you can spend 4 Purple Flame points to enhance it. The range increases to 36 meters, the affected area increases to a 12-meter square, and the creatures have disadvantage on the Dexterity saving throw.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Lava Hands (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have mastered an advanced Extension Technique, requiring immense Cursed Energy manipulation.

As an action, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to create up to two Lava Hands within 36 meters of you for 1 minute.

The Lava Hand is a gargantuan object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to half your hit point maximum (rounded down). If it drops to 0 hit points, the technique ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0).

On the turn you activate this technique and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the hands up to 20 meters and command them to perform one of the following effects.

***Clenched Fist.*** The hand strikes a creature or object within 1 meter. Make a melee weapon attack using the hand’s Strength modifier. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 Fire damage.

***Forceful Hand.*** The hand attempts to push a creature within 1 meter. The hand makes a Strength check, contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) check. If the target is Medium or smaller, the hand has advantage on the check. On a success, the target is pushed 1 meter plus your Charisma modifier in meters in a direction you choose. The hand moves with the target to remain within 1 meter.

***Grasping Hand.*** The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 1 meter. The hand makes a Strength (Athletics) check against the target’s contested check. If the target is Medium or smaller, the hand has advantage on the check. While grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to crush it, dealing 5d10 plus your Charisma modifier Bludgeoning damage.

***Interposing Hand.*** The hand positions itself between you and a creature of your choice, remaining there until you issue a different command. The hand grants you half cover against that creature. The target cannot move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength. If the target’s Strength is higher, it can move through the space, but the area is difficult terrain, and the creature takes Fire damage equal to your Jujutsu Sorcerer level at the start of its turns.

You must maintain concentration on this technique. It ends if the hands drop to 0 HP, 1 minute passes, or you lose concentration.

## Level 20: Maximum Meteor (Maximum Technique)
You have learned to push your Disaster Flames to their absolute limit, unleashing your Maximum Technique. As an action for 20 Cursed Energy, you summon a meteor at a point within 30 meters. The meteor forms a 20-meter-radius sphere. You can move the meteor up to 20 meters in any direction as a bonus action. Any creatures overlapped by the meteor for the first time during this movement are dragged to the end of its path.

Any creature (except you) that touches the meteor must make a Dexterity saving throw (with advantage). On a failure, they take 30d12 Fire damage and 30d12 Bludgeoning damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they receive *Second Degree Burns*. If they fail by 5 or more, they receive *Third Degree Burns*. On a success, they take half damage and receive *First Degree Burns*. If they succeed and possess *Endurance*, they do not receive burns. Objects in the meteor’s path automatically take this damage. This technique deals twice the maximum damage possible to objects and structures.

The meteor lasts for 1 minute, until it touches the ground, or until you lose concentration (as if concentrating on a spell).

***Purple Meteor.*** When you use this technique, you may spend 6 Purple Flame points to enhance it. Its radius increases to 36 meters and creatures make the Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage.

## Technique Reversal: Heat Extinguishment
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

By mastering Reverse Cursed Technique alongside your primary ability, you've inverted your control over flames, gaining the power to extinguish and nullify them—even affecting the heat within living beings.

As an action, or as a reaction when targeted by a ranged cursed energy attack that deals fire damage, you may spend 2 cursed energy per 2 square meter of flames extinguished, removing up to 3 times your Charisma modifier in square meter of fire within a 10-meter radius. When used as a reaction, the attack dissipates, and you take no damage. If used against an area-of-effect attack, you may reduce its range by the number of square meter of flames extinguished, potentially avoiding the attack altogether.

***Hypothermic Touch.*** As an action, if a target has suffered a slashing or piercing attack within the last round, is under the Bleeding condition, or otherwise has an open wound, you may spend up to twice your Charisma modifier in cursed energy to make a melee attack roll, extinguishing the heat within their body. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 cold damage per cursed energy spent. On a success, they take half damage.

If they fail the save by 5 or more, they gain the Chilled condition.

This ability has no effect on creatures that do not rely on body heat or are immune to cold damage.

At 17th level, you can spend up to three times your Charisma modifier, and at 20th level, you can spend up to four times your Charisma modifier.
