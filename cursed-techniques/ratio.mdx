As a user of Ratio, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Ratio
You have developed the Ratio Technique, which allows you to pinpoint weak spots in your enemies. Whenever you make a melee weapon attack roll, you can spend 1 Cursed Energy to roll a d10. If you roll a 3 or a 7, the attack is considered a critical hit for the damage calculation. If you have advantage on the attack, you can re-roll the d10.

Additionally, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon, you roll triple the damage dice instead of the usual double.

At 3rd level, you roll four times the damage dice. At 10th level, you roll five times the damage dice. At 20th level, you roll six times the damage dice.

## Level 3: Critical Attacker (Technique Improvement)
Your ability to precisely target weak points in your opponent's defenses improves. Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

## Level 6: Collapse (Extension Technique)
You have discovered a way to find the weak points in objects, shattering them and imbuing them with your cursed energy to gain some control over them. 

As an action, you can spend 4 Cursed Energy to strike a solid surface within reach and destroy a 5-meter radius of it. The area becomes difficult terrain, and the debris is imbued with your cursed energy, allowing it to remain suspended in the air up to 5 meters from the surface for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier.

As part of the same action, you can use the suspended debris as 3/4 cover and make the area lightly obscured by a cloud of dust. Afterward, you can release the suspended debris without using an action. Every creature caught under the falling debris must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take your unarmed strike's damage plus 3d10 Bludgeoning damage. This unarmed strikeâ€™s damage is affected by Ratio, as if it were a critical hit. On a success, they take half as much damage.

The damage increases to 6d10 at 11th level, 10d10 at 17th level, and 15d10 at 20th level.

## Level 10: Improved Ratio (Technique Improvement)
You have become even more lethal and precise with your Ratio Technique. 

Whenever you use Ratio, you may spend additional Cursed Energy up to your Charisma modifier to add an extra d10 of damage per point spent.

Additionally, your Ratio Technique now rolls 2 d10s instead of just 1, increasing your chances of hitting a critical point.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Ratioed Weapon (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Once per turn, whenever you successfully land an attack against a target and use Ratio, you can spend 4 additional Cursed Energy to imbue your weapon or unarmed strike with Ratio on impact. You must roll Ratio for both the target and your weapon.

If you successfully hit the Ratio for both the target and your weapon, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they suffer 2 levels of exhaustion (with a maximum of 3 levels of exhaustion from this effect). On a success, they are not affected by exhaustion.

If you fail the Ratio roll for the target, the attack still hits, but the target is not affected by Ratio. If you fail the Ratio roll for your weapon, and you were using a weapon, it instantly shatters. If you were using an unarmed strike, the limb you used breaks and becomes unusable unless healed by magical healing or naturally over time.

If you fail both Ratio rolls, you suffer the detriments of failing both: your weapon shatters or your limb breaks, and the target is unaffected by Ratio.

## Level 20: Perfect Strike (Technique Improvement)
You have perfected the art of targeting your enemies' weak spots. Whenever you use your Ratio technique with a melee weapon attack, your proficiency bonus is doubled. You will always roll 3 d10s for the Ratio check without spending extra Cursed Energy. Additionally, whenever you add a d10 to your Ratio, you may instead add 2 d10s.

Furthermore, your melee weapon attacks can never be made with disadvantage.

## Technique Reversal: 7-3 Proportion
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Through great mastery of the Reversed Cursed Technique, you have learned to invert your own Ratio, placing it onto yourself to develop weak points while reinforcing all other areas beyond comparison. 

As a bonus action or reaction, whenever an attack is made against you or you roll a saving throw, you can spend 8 Cursed Energy to impose the Ratio onto your body for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

By doing so, you gain resistance to all damage types, damage reduction equal to half your Jujutsu Sorcerer level (rounded down), and any existing damage resistance you have prior to using the Ratio turns into damage immunity. The damage resistance, reduction, and immunities apply whenever you take damage, unless the attack roll results in a 3 or 7 on the d20, in which case it hits you regardless of your AC. Similarly, if you roll a 3 or 7 on a saving throw against a damaging effect, you automatically fail the save.
