As a user of the Rot Technique, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Rotten Blood
Your Cursed Energy and blood are malformed to rot, granting you resistance to Acid damage when you activate your Cursed Energy Armor. When you deal damage with the Curse-Empowered Strikes or Cursed Energy Ray feature, you can change the damage type to Acid.

## Level 1: Blood Points
Blood Points are a currency used to power this Innate Technique’s abilities, alongside Cursed Energy. You expend your own hit points to gain Blood Points, with 1 Blood Point per hit point lost. If you have the Cursed Projectiles feat, you can use Blood Points instead of Cursed Energy for this feature, spending 2 Blood Points for every 1 Cursed Energy. You may only use your own blood to generate Blood Points.

If you have the Energy to Blood feat, Blood Points are affected by Tokyo School's cursed energy economy feature.

***Water Dilution.*** Your mastery over blood manipulation is significantly hindered when submerged in large volumes of water. While you are at least half submerged, you cannot use any of your Technique features that manipulate blood externally. The sheer volume of water disrupts the integrity of blood, preventing it from holding its shape and making external manipulation impossible. While submerged, you cannot use the Darkened Blood Manipulation, Evolved Darkened Blood Manipulation, or Wing King features for the duration of your submersion or while in heavy rain. If you attempt to use these techniques, you will spend cursed energy and Blood Points as normal, but nothing will happen.

## Level 1: Rot Technique
Your blood is dark, toxic, and corrosive, capable of burning skin and eating away at solid rock. Whenever you use any features of this Technique, the damage type can be changed to Acid.

Additionally, whenever a feature from this Technique hits a creature, whether through an attack roll or a saving throw, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 1d8 additional acid damage, or half as much on a success.

The additional acid damage increases to 3d8 at 5th level, 6d8 at 11th level, 10d8 at 17th level, and 15d8 at 20th level.

## Level 1: Darkened Blood Manipulation (Lapse Technique)
Your control over your corrupted, toxic blood allows you to unleash devastating attacks. You gain the following offensive techniques:

***Blood Lance.*** You shape your toxic blood into a long, piercing lance. As an action, by expending 2 Cursed Energy and 3 Blood Points, you conjure a lance of blood and hurl it at a creature within 10 meters. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 2d8 piercing damage, or half as much on a success. The damage increases to 4d8 at 11th level, 6d8 at 17th level, and 8d8 at 20th level.

***Rotting Surge.*** You send a wave of rotting blood surging towards your enemies. As an action, by expending 4 Cursed Energy and 6 Blood Points, you create a wave of blood that crashes in a 5-meter cone in front of you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 3d8 bludgeoning damage and are poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and are not poisoned. The damage increases to 6d8 at 11th level, 9d8 at 17th level, and 12d8 at 20th level.

***Blood Spit.*** As an action, by expending 2 Cursed Energy and 3 Blood Points, you spit corrosive blood at a creature within 6 meters. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 2d6 bludgeoning damage, or half as much on a success. The damage increases to 4d6 at 11th level, 8d6 at 17th level, and 12d6 at 20th level.

## Level 3: Decay (Extension Technique)
You have developed an extension to kill targets from a distance. As a bonus action, by expending 4 Cursed Energy, you can target a creature that has failed a saving throw against your Rot Technique or that has been hit by a feature from this technique in the last minute. You cover them in a floral pattern known to kill opponents in minutes. They must make a Constitution saving throw at the beginning of their turns, suffering the effects of failing a Rot Technique saving throw on a failure and the effects of succeeding on it on a success.

When targeted this way, the Rot Technique instead reduces a creature's maximum hit points by the damage it deals. At the end of a long rest, the creature's maximum hit points return to normal. You must spend 2 Cursed Energy at the beginning of your turns to keep this effect active. This technique can only be deactivated if you fall unconscious or deactivate it at will.

At 5th level, you can target a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier with this technique. At 11th level, you inflict the poisoned condition on any creatures currently affected by the technique. At 17th level, you now only need to spend 1 Cursed Energy to keep the technique active. At 20th level, you no longer need to spend Cursed Energy to maintain it. A creature with the Reinforced Immune System feat is not poisoned by this feature.

## Level 6: Evolved Darkened Blood Manipulation (Technique Improvement)
You have learned to use your blood for both offensive and defensive strategies. You gain the following techniques:

***Crimson Augment.*** You channel your rotting blood into a melee attack, empowering your strikes. Once per turn, when you make a melee weapon attack, you can expend 4 Cursed Energy and 3 Blood Points to augment your strikes with your blood. On a hit, the target takes normal damage plus an additional 2d8 acid damage. The additional acid damage increases to 5d8 at 11th level, 9d8 at 17th level, and 14d8 at 20th level.

***Blood Shield.*** You can create a protective barrier of your blood. As a reaction, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can expend 8 Cursed Energy and 6 Blood Points to form a shield of blood that absorbs damage equal to the total amount spent times half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). If the shield absorbs all damage, the attacker must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take damage equal to the Rot Technique's damage dice and are poisoned. On a success, they take half the damage and are not poisoned.

***Reconstructive Blood.*** You can use your blood to reconstruct your own limbs. As a bonus action, by expending an amount of Cursed Energy based on the limb and an equal amount of Blood Points, you can recreate a lost limb by making a blood copy of it. It works exactly the same as the original, but every creature you touch or hit with it suffers from your Rot Technique feature. The limb lasts for 1 minute, after which it is destroyed.

| Limb | Cursed Energy Cost |
|:-|:-|
| Tiny Limbs (Ears, fingers, teeth) | 2 Cursed Energy per Limb |
| Medium Limbs (Arms, legs) | 4 Cursed Energy per Limb |

## Level 10: Wing King (Maximum Technique)
With extended usage of your technique, you have developed a maximum technique that manipulates your blood to shape large, wasp-like wings. As a bonus action, by expending 10 Cursed Energy and 10 Blood Points, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Your wasp wings keep you above the ground, making you stay at least 3 meters above the ground for the duration.
- You can move with your wings, granting you a +30 bonus to your movement speed and a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
- You can replace attacks in the Attack action to use any one of your offensive Rot Technique features instead.
- You gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws.
- You can use Homing Blood.

You cannot use this feature and the Decay feature at the same time.

***Homing Blood.*** As an action, for 8 Cursed Energy and 15 Blood Points, you create a homing beam of blood. Make a ranged cursed energy attack roll against a creature within 40 meters of you, dealing 7d8 piercing damage on a hit. If the attack misses, you may choose to re-roll it, up to a number of times per turn equal to half your Charisma modifier (rounded down). The beam’s damage increases to 10d8 at 17th level and 14d8 at 20th level.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Life to Energy (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have developed an extension for your technique that harnesses the power of decay to siphon not only the life but also the energy of your enemies. As a reaction, by expending 10 Cursed Energy, when a creature takes damage from your Decay Technique, you can make them lose a portion of their energy. The target loses an amount of Cursed Energy equal to ¼ of the damage dealt.

If the target has no remaining Cursed Energy, they instead take additional damage equal to the amount they would have lost in Cursed Energy, effectively doubling the damage dealt by the Decay Technique.

Additionally, for each creature affected by this feature, you regain Cursed Energy equal to half the amount lost, rounding down.

## Level 20: The Rotten One (Technique Improvement)
You have mastered the Rot Technique, making perfect use of your blood. Your acid damage now overcomes resistance to acid damage, and creatures must make your Constitution saving throw with disadvantage. Additionally, you now overcome immunity to the poisoned condition, and it now inflicts the burned condition on a failed Constitution saving throw.

## Technique Reversal: Bloom Technique
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

With your mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique comes your technique reversal. You now know how to change what rots the body into something that blooms health within it.

### Rot Technique
Your blood is a healthy, vibrant red, capable of healing the body whenever it touches it. Whenever you use any features of this Technique, the damage that would have been dealt instead heals the same amount of hit points.

Additionally, whenever a feature from this technique hits a creature, whether through an attack roll or a saving throw, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, nothing happens. On a successful save, the cost of using those features is doubled, but the target regains an additional 2d8 hit points.

The additional healing increases to 3d8 at 5th level, 6d8 at 11th level, 10d8 at 17th level, and 15d8 at 20th level.
