As a user of the Picture Alteration, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Picture Alteration (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to make anything you manipulate in a picture you take become real, causing reality to alter itself in response. 

You start with one of the following cellphones, depending on your financial condition, which is determined by you and your DM during character creation.

|Cellphone Quality|Picture Range|
|:-|:-:|
|Very Poor|6 m.|
|Poor|12 m.|
|Average|30 m.|
|Above Average|60 m.|
|High Quality|90 m.|

The cellphone now counts as a cursed tool.

As a reaction to a hostile action from a creature or as a free action for 2 cursed energy, you can take a picture with your cellphone that captures a cone of X meters. You can then alter the picture as a bonus action or reaction, or as part of using it as a reaction. At this moment, you can only alter very basic things in the picture.

***Move.*** You can move a number of objects or creatures up to your proficiency bonus to anywhere within the picture. Each object or creature moved after the first costs 1 additional cursed energy. Any objects you are holding or carrying move alongside you.

You can only alter pictures taken with this technique until the end of your next turn, and you can make only one alteration per turn. If you try to alter an unwilling creature or an object that is currently being held, the creature or object's wielder must make a Charisma saving throw against your cursed energy DC. On a failure, they are affected by your alteration; on a success, they are not moved.

## Level 3: Improved Move (Technique Improvement)
Your ability to edit pictures has become so fast that you have essentially learned how to teleport. When you use your Move technique, you no longer provoke opportunity attacks while moving, and any creatures that were touching you are also moved without requiring additional cursed energy.

Additionally, you can now move creatures upwards and downwards. Whenever a creature is moved upwards, they will begin falling at the start of your next turn.

## Level 6: Filter (Technique Improvement)
While many teenagers use this ability to create cute images or funny faces, you have discovered a combat application for it! As an action after taking a picture, you can apply a filter to alter a creature within the picture.

If you try to apply a filter to an unwilling creature or an object that is currently being held, the creature or object's wielder must make a Charisma saving throw against your cursed energy DC. On a failure, they are affected by your filter; on a success, they are not. You may apply the following filters:

|Filter|Effect|Cursed energy cost|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Heart Eyes|The creature is [charmed](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Charmed) by you until the beginning of your next turn.|2|
|Sweat on Forehead|The creature becomes anxious and nervous, feeling [frightened](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Frightened) of every creature near them until the beginning of your next turn.|3|
|Vomiting|The creature feels nauseated and becomes [poisoned](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Poisoned) until the beginning of your next turn.|4|
|Angry Mark|The creature becomes consumed by anger, entering a [berserk](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Berserk) state until the beginning of your next turn.|5|
|Skull|The creature is absolutely flabbergasted that you just took a picture of it, becoming [stunned](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Stunned) until the beginning of your next turn or until they take damage from an outside source.|5|
|Halo|The creature is filled with pure thoughts, causing its alignment to change to lawful good. They cannot make any evil actions (as determined by the DM) until the beginning of your next turn.|6|
|Devil Horns|The creature is filled with diabolical thoughts, causing its alignment to change to chaotic evil. They cannot make any good actions (as determined by the DM) until the beginning of your next turn.|6|
|Blush|The creature feels shy and cannot take any actions while they remain within your sight range until the beginning of your next turn.|7|
|Sleeping|The creature feels sleepy and falls [unconscious](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Unconscious) until the beginning of your next turn. The condition ends early if the creature takes damage.|10|

## Level 10: Photoshop (Extension Technique)
While you could already alter creatures and objects based on your pictures, you have now installed an app that enhances this ability. 

As an action, after taking a picture, you can use Photoshop to change the picture, choosing one of three categories to alter: Objects, environment, or creatures. 

The alterations you can make within each category are detailed below, but you can only perform one alteration per turn using this extension.

### Object Alteration
|Alteration|Alteration Effect|Cursed Energy Cost|
|:-|:-|:-:|
|Value|The object's rarity is increased by one level for each energy spent until the beginning of your next turn. For example, a common watch would become an uncommon watch.|2 per rarity increased|
|Size|The object's size is increased by one level for each energy spent, causing its weight to multiply by 8 and all of its dimensions to double until the beginning of your next turn. For example, a medium vehicle would become a large vehicle.|3 per size increased|
|Properties|You grant the object a new property, giving it an additional function until the beginning of your next turn. For example, you could grant a shortsword the versatile property.|4|

### Creature Alteration
|Alteration|Alteration Effect|Cursed Energy Cost|
|:-|:-|:-:|
|Looks Maxxing|The creature's appearance is greatly improved, making them look stunning. They gain a bonus to their Charisma checks equal to your Charisma modifier and roll Persuasion checks with advantage.|4|
|Size Decrease/Increase|The creature is shrunk or increased, altering its size. For each energy spent, you reduce or increase their size by one level until the beginning of your next turn. If decreased, their weight is divided by 8 and all of their dimensions are halved. If increased, their weight multiplies by 8 and all of their dimensions double for the duration.|5 per size change|
|Muscular Body|The creature gets absolutely ripped, gaining a significant boost in muscle. They gain a bonus to their Strength score equal to your Charisma modifier, which can exceed their maximum, and they have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws until the beginning of your next turn.|6|
|Misery|The creature looks completely miserable and in a precarious situation. They gain two levels of exhaustion, which are removed at the beginning of your next turn. These levels of exhaustion cannot increase a creature's exhaustion level beyond 3.|8|

### Environment Alteration
|Alteration|Alteration Effect|Cursed Energy Cost|
|:-|:-|:-:|
|Rain|The area becomes surrounded by clouds until the beginning of your next turn. During this time, light rain falls in the area, extinguishing unprotected flames. You can also cause harmless claps of thunder or flashes of lightning to emanate from the clouds.|4|
|Snow|Snow begins to cover the area, reducing visibility. The snow obscures all sight, including Darkvision, but not Truesight, beyond 1 meter until the beginning of your next turn.|5|
|Lightning Strike|A lightning bolt strikes the area, targeting a creature of your choice. One creature within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 8d6 lightning damage, or half as much on a success.|6|

If you try to apply Photoshop to an unwilling creature or an object that is currently being held, the creature or object's wielder must make a Charisma saving throw against your cursed energy DC. On a failure, they are affected by the Photoshop alteration; on a success, they are not affected.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Share (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned in Tokyo that the greatest power you can possess is friendship. 

As part of making an alteration, you can quickly share the picture with another cellphone within 1.6 km of you by spending twice the normal amount of cursed energy. 

The creature receiving the picture will cause the effects of your alteration to occur in a X-meter cone, directed by where they point their cellphone. 

This technique also grants the phone you shared the picture with high-quality Wi-Fi until the beginning of your next turn.

## Level 20: Delete (Extension Technique)
You have learned how to erase pictures. Whenever you take a picture with your technique, you can spend 20 cursed energy as an action to erase all of the following from the picture: objects, structures, or creatures.

If you choose a creature, they must make a Charisma saving throw or take 20d10 necrotic damage, with half damage on a successful save. If you choose an object or structure, they automatically fail the saving throw. 

This technique deals twice as much damage to objects and structures, and it does not affect objects that are carried or worn.

## Technique Reversal: Backspace
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

After mastering Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked your cursed technique reversal. 

You can now use your phone with positive energy to revert effects. If you see someone activate their innate technique, you can use a reaction and spend 5 cursed energy to force them to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, their technique is forced to revert and does not activate. On a success, the technique proceeds as normal.

Additionally, you can use this ability as an action to end an ongoing effect by spending 5 cursed energy. The user of the ongoing technique must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the ongoing technique ends. On a success, the effect continues as usual.
