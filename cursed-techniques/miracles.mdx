As a user of the Miracles, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

<Note>
	When you're in a campaign where someone has this technique, make sure to only allow them to gain Miracles through genuine interactions and avoid letting them overuse it in non-roleplay situations. This ensures the ability remains balanced and tied to meaningful in-game moments, maintaining the integrity of the roleplay experience.
</Note>

## Level 1: Miracles (Lapse Technique)
Your technique grants you strength by witnessing good fortune. Sometimes, you are fortunate enough to see miracles happen right in front of you. 

Whenever you witness a miracle, a Purple Marking appears right under one of your eyes, granting you a Miracle Mark. You can accumulate up to 6 Miracle Marks beneath your eyes. The miracles you can witness and benefit from are listed below:

|Miracle|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Lucky|Hitting a jackpot is exciting for everyone, not just those with gambling addictions! Whenever you or an ally you can see or hear rolls the maximum possible result on a dice roll, you gain 1 Miracle Mark. If the roll is for damage, all of the rolls must be the maximum amount to trigger the Miracle Mark.|
|Equal Numbers|Equal numbers mean good luck—time to celebrate! Whenever you or an ally you can see or hear rolls two equal numbers, such as 11, 22, 33, 44, and so on, you gain 1 Miracle Mark.|
|Treasure|Finding free stuff is always great! Every time you or an ally you can see discovers a new item, weapon, or armor of at least Rare rarity, you gain 1 Miracle Mark. This only applies to cursed tools and magical items.|
|Overcoming Hardship|Overcoming hardships is rare in such a vile world, making it a true miracle when it happens. Whenever you or an ally you can see or hear succeeds in a saving throw or ability check, or lands an attack roll where you had disadvantage, you gain 1 Miracle Mark.|

Whenever you are about to take damage, you can spend 1 Miracle Mark to regain Xd4 + your Charisma modifier hit points (with X being your Jujutsu Sorcerer level), up to your hit point maximum. You can use this once per round. However, you may use this technique again in the same round by spending a reaction and 2 cursed energy.

At 11th level, you gain 2 Miracle Marks for every miracle you witness. This increases to 3 Miracle Marks at 17th level.

## Level 3: Change Outcome (Extension Technique)
You have learned that your miracles can even change reality in your favor.

Whenever you fail a roll, you can use your reaction to spend 1 Miracle Mark and 2 cursed energy to roll a d6. After rolling, add it to the result of your original roll.

The d6 increases to a d8 at 5th level, to a d10 at 11th level, and to a d12 at 17th level.

## Level 6: Death Escape (Extension Technique)
It’s a miracle, you escaped death!

Whenever you are hit by an attack or fail a saving throw that would reduce you to 0 hit points or lower (even if it would kill you outright), you can spend 2 Miracle Marks and 4 cursed energy to avoid it, escaping completely unharmed in an unexplainable way.

In addition, while you have Miracle Markings, you roll death saving throws with advantage.

At 11th level, you can use this Extension whenever an attack or saving throw would reduce you to below half of your maximum hit points (rounded up) as well.

## Level 10: Fate Control (Technique Improvement)
There is no bad future for you, only a shining, bright road of success!

Whenever you succeed on a roll that was altered by Outcome Change, if the result reaches a 20 or higher (counting the natural die with no modifiers), it counts as a natural 20. 

This natural 20 obtained this way does not count as a miracle, nor does it count for other purposes such as Black Flash. It only counts as a critical success or a critical hit.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Shared Luck
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You've developed a way to share your luck with others. 

As a reaction to an ally you can see failing a roll, you can spend 3 Miracle Marks and 10 cursed energy to add your current Outcome Change die to their roll. 

If they succeed because of it, it is considered a natural 20. The natural 20 obtained this way does not count as a miracle.

## Level 20: Pinnacle of Luck (Technique Improvement)
There is no such thing as a bad day; in fact, the concept of something bad happening is unknown to you. 

You add your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to any rolls you make with a d20.

## Technique Reversal: Calamity
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

After mastering Reverse Cursed Technique, you discovered your technique reversal and learned about Calamity Marks. 

Whenever you witness a calamity happening, a Yellow Marking appears right above one of your eyes, granting you a Calamity Mark. You can have up to 6 Calamity Marks above your eyes. The calamities are listed below :

|Calamity|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Unlucky|Failing makes no one but the person who failed sad. Whenever you or a hostile creature you can see or hear rolls the minimum amount they could on a dice roll, you gain 1 Calamity Mark.|
|Opposite Numbers|Nobody likes opposite numbers; they just look ugly. Every time you or a hostile creature you can see or hear rolls two different numbers, with the first being odd and the second being even (such as 12, 14, 16, 18, and so on), you gain 1 Calamity Mark.|
|Trash|Finding free stuff is cool, but only if it’s valuable. Every time you or a hostile creature you can see finds a new item, weapon, or armor of at most Uncommon rarity, you gain 1 Calamity Mark. This only counts towards cursed tools and magical items.|
|Failing with Ease|Failure is something so commun in such a vile world we live in, so witnessing it is truly a calamity. Whenever you or a hostile creature you can see or hear fails a saving throw or ability check, or misses an attack roll where they had advantage, you gain 1 Calamity Mark.|

As a reaction to a hostile creature succeeding on a roll, you can spend 2 Calamity Marks and 4 cursed energy to roll a d10. After rolling it, subtract the result from their roll. If this causes their roll to fail and it reaches a 1 or lower (counting the natural die with no modifiers), it is considered as if they have rolled a natural 1 for all purposes, except for features that specifically avoid natural 1s.
