As a user of the Mythical Beast Amber, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Electric Cursed Energy
You were born with a unique cursed energy, granting you distinct properties that set you apart from other sorcerers. 

You gain the Unique Cursed Energy feat and have lightning as your Cursed Energy Type. Additionally, you gain both the Wellspring of Energy and Dynamic Striker features from the background feat.

Furthermore, whenever you deal damage with an unarmed strike while using Cursed Energy Enhancement, you add bonus lightning damage to your damage roll equal to your proficiency bonus.

### Water Weakness
Due to your cursed energy behaving like electricity, it conducts exceptionally well through water, making it difficult to control. If you spend cursed energy while at least half-submerged in water, the amount spent is instead equal to your current cursed energy amount, which cannot be reduced. However, this does not enhance the ability you are using, even if it would normally scale with additional cursed energy.

If you are aware of electrolysis and are in salt water, you can attempt to use this drawback to your advantage. As an action, you may make a DC 20 Charisma check. On a success, you produce a 10-meter radius cloud of chlorine gas around you. Creatures that start their turn in the cloud must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they become poisoned and take 10d10 poison damage. On a success, they take half damage and do not become poisoned.

This cloud lasts 1 minute and, if you are fully submerged, it instead forms at the surface of the water directly above you. At the start of your turn, if there is wind, the cloud may move up to 10 meters in the direction of the wind.

## Level 1: Pure Manipulation
None of the features in this subclass, except for Mythical Beast Amber, are considered cursed technique features. As such, they are not affected by cursed technique enhancements like Tokyo Jujutsu High School, Maximum Output, Chanting, and similar abilities.

As a result, if a player chooses the Tokyo Jujutsu High School, they can treat this subclass as a Sorcerer Path instead of an Innate Technique for their character.

## Level 1: Flawless Reduction
If you have the Flawless Fundamentals cursed feat, certain features of this subclass will be affected accordingly.

- If you choose to reduce the cost of your Innate Technique, the technique-related features granted by this subclass will have their cost reduced.
- If you choose to reduce the cost of your Sorcerer Path, the cursed energy-related features granted by this subclass will have their cost reduced.

## Level 1: Mythical Beast Amber (Lapse Technique)
Your technique reconstructs your flesh to manifest phenomena created by electricity, converting your cursed energy into raw power. However, because this technique forces your body beyond human limitations, it can only be used once before your body collapses when the technique concludes.

As a bonus action for 10 cursed energy, your body begins to fill with electric cursed energy, causing you to grow in power over a short period. This technique lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution score (minimum of 10). Once the duration ends, you are instantly killed.

As the technique progresses, you gain various benefits from your increasing electrical energy as described below. However, if an effect would deactivate your Innate Technique, such as being struck by the Inverted Spear of Heaven, you immediately revert to normal. 

Whenever your technique is deactivated, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 10 + 5 for every 5 rounds that have passed while using this form and suffer the consequences.

<Note>
	Reminder: 1 minute is 10 rounds.

You also gain access to the following technique :

#### Lightning Claw
Upon activating your technique, your cursed energy envelops your hands, forming claws of electricity. 

Your unarmed strikes now deal lightning damage, and their damage dice increase by one step (if your unarmed strikes do not have a damage die, they are treated as d4 for this feature).

You also gain access to the following technique :

#### Loud Blast
Your jaw becomes covered in cursed energy, allowing you to unleash powerful sonic blasts from your mouth. 

As an action, you can spend 1 cursed energy to make a cursed energy attack roll against a creature within 10 meters. On a hit, the target takes Xd10 lightning damage (where X is your Charisma modifier). 

Even if the attack misses, all creatures within a 5-meter radius of the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take Xd8 thunder damage (where X is your proficiency bonus) and are deafened until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, they take half damage and are not deafened. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, they are deafened for 1 minute instead. They may remake the saving throw at the start of each of their turns, ending the effect early on a success.

Your form allows you to unleash a powerful beam of light.

On a failed save, a creature takes Xd12 lightning damage (where X is twice your Charisma modifier) and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is blinded, but only until the beginning of your next turn. Creatures with Endurance are not blinded on a successful save. They can attempt a Constitution saving throw at the start of their turns to end the blindness effect early on a success. If a creature's Dexterity score is lower than your cursed energy DC, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage. 

Additionally, you can spend more cursed energy, up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), to add one additional damage die and increase the saving throw DC by 1.

#### Deactivation
- On a successful save: You are reduced to ¼ of your maximum hit points.
- On a failed save: You die.

## Level 3: Battle Sparks (Cursed Energy Feature)
Your cursed energy constantly electrifies your body, filling you with excitement for battle. Small sparks of lightning constantly flicker in your eyes, a sign that your energy is always replenishing you. Due to the immense power of your innate technique, you have learned to harness your unique cursed energy in combat, creating what you call Battle Sparks.

You gain the following Battle Sparks:

Sparks. Once per turn, when you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 cursed energy to add 2d10 lightning damage to the attack’s total damage. This damage increases to 3d10 at 5th level, 4d10 at 11th level, 5d10 at 17th level, and 6d10 at 20th level.

***Lightning Reaction.*** When an attack you can see is made against you, you can spend 1 cursed energy as a reaction to increase your AC by your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) against the triggering attack. This bonus lasts until the start of your next turn and does not stack if this reaction is used multiple times.

***Wheel of Lightning.*** You can spend 2 cursed energy to slam a melee weapon you’re holding on the ground as a reaction when a hostile creature moves toward you. All creatures in a 5-meter radius centered on you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take your Sparks’ damage die in lightning damage and are pushed 3 meters back. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and are not pushed. If they fail by 5 or more, they are also knocked prone.

***Lightning Ray.*** As an action, you can spend 1 or more cursed energy to launch lightning rays at your opponents. Make one or more ranged cursed energy attack rolls against creatures within 10 meters of you. On a hit, a creature takes your Sparks’ damage die in lightning damage. For each additional cursed energy you spend, you make one additional ranged cursed energy attack roll against the same or different targets. You can spend cursed energy in this way up to the number of attacks you can make per turn, excluding features like Cursed Blast or Flurry of Blows.

***System Stop.*** Once per round, you can spend 3 additional cursed energy when using Sparks to force the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is paralyzed until the beginning of their next turn or until they take damage from an external source.

## Level 6: Lightning Discharge (Cursed Energy Feature)
You have become a master at manipulating your cursed energy, using it like electric charges. 

Whenever you deal damage with your Sparks, you may spend additional cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier to apply a positive charge to the target. After applying the positive charge, you may use your bonus action to apply a negative charge to the ground. This creates a reaction, sending a bolt of lightning straight to the target’s head if they are within 10 meters of you. The target takes Xd8 lightning damage (where X is your Charisma modifier plus the amount of cursed energy spent) and must make a Constitution saving throw at disadvantage. On a failed save, the target is paralyzed until the beginning of their next turn or until they take damage from an external source.

A creature can only have one positive charge at a time.

***Pure Discharge.*** You can also unleash a powerful discharge of lightning around you. As an action, you can spend 8 cursed energy to create a 10-meter radius of lightning centered on you, forcing all creatures within the area to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 8d12 lightning damage and are paralyzed until the beginning of their next turn or until they take damage from an outside source.

## Level 10: Rapid Ignition (Technique Improvement)
You have learned to accelerate the stages of your lapse technique, allowing you to transform your body into cursed energy more quickly and gain its benefits sooner. 

When using Mythical Beast Amber, the time required to progress through each level is reduced by 5 rounds.

If your technique is deactivated, you still suffer the detriments of the stage from which you have gained benefits. 

For example, if you have been in Mythical Beast Amber for 1 minute but have gained the benefits of 1 minute and 5 rounds, and your technique is deactivated, you would make the Constitution saving throw as though you were in it for 1 minute and 5 rounds. This also means you would experience the effects listed for 1 minute and 5 rounds.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Semi Activation (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You were never willing to sacrifice yourself to fully activate your technique. However, during your time in Tokyo, you learned that survival in the jujutsu world requires a certain level of greed. This realization led you to develop an extension technique that allows you to partially activate your ability, sacrificing a body part in exchange for a brief surge of power.

As a bonus action, you can spend 5 cursed energy to transform one of the following body parts:
|Body Part|Benefits|
|:-|:-|
Arms|You transform your arms into lightning, greatly enhancing your hand-to-hand combat abilities. Your unarmed strikes now deal lightning damage. Additionally, you can make one extra attack during your attack action. This attack must be an unarmed strike.|
Legs|You transform your legs into lightning, significantly boosting your speed. Your walking speed increases by 10 meters, and you gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws.|
Eyes|You transform your eyes into lightning, enhancing your vision. You gain 10 meters of truesight and have advantage on Perception checks related to sight.|
Jaw|Your jaw becomes charged with lightning, allowing you to unleash powerful sonic screeches. As an action, you can spend 1 cursed energy to make a cursed energy attack roll against a creature within 10 meters of you. On a hit, the target takes Xd8 lightning damage (where X is your Charisma modifier). Even if the attack misses, all creatures within a 5-meter radius of the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take Xd6 thunder damage (where X is your proficiency bonus) and are deafened until the beginning of your next turn. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and are not deafened.|

This semi-activation lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). After the transformation, the limbs used are reduced to 0 hit points and are completely turned to ashes, effectively being removed.

You cannot use Semi Activation and Mythical Beast Amber simultaneously.

Additionally, if you possess Cursed Technique Reversal, you can spend a bonus action and 10 cursed energy to restore a limb to normal before the duration ends, preventing it from being lost.

## Level 20: Mythical Mastery (Technique Improvement)
You have mastered everything there is to know about lightning, from your unique cursed energy to your technique. 

As a result, your Mythical Beast Amber technique now lasts additional rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).

Additionally, any lightning damage you deal now bypasses resistances, though it still does not affect immunities.

## Technique Reversal: Mythical Beast Amber Suppressed
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Your mastery of the Reverse Cursed Technique has granted you the ability to reverse your lapse technique, allowing you to return your body to flesh after using it. 

As a bonus action, while your lapse technique is active, you can spend 20 cursed energy to begin reversing its effects. The amount of time you were using your lapse now becomes the amount of time it will take to fully reverse the effects.

As you reach each threshold in the reversal process, you lose the benefits your lapse technique provided, and the saving throw required to maintain the form becomes easier. If you wait for the full duration of your lapse technique, it will automatically deactivate, and you do not need to make a saving throw to exit the form.
