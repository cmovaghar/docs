As a user of the Paralyzing Sight, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Special Eyes
Due to your technique, your eyes hold special importance compared to most sorcerers, and as such, they are reinforced.

### Eye Hit Points
Your eyes have a number of hit points equal to 1/3rd of your hit point maximum (rounded up). You regain 1 eye hit point at the beginning of your turns unless they are at 0 hit points. Any kind of hit point regain you receive also affects your eyes' hit points.

Your eyes regain all of their hit points at the end of a short or long rest.

### Losing Eye Hit Points
Whenever a hostile creature (or a creature that isn't your ally) succeeds on a saving throw against your technique, your eyes lose 2 hit points for every 1 they rolled above your cursed energy DC (with a minimum of 1).

If your eyes reach 0 hit points, you won't be able to regain their hit points unless you receive the benefits of Reverse Cursed Technique, Regeneration, or take a long rest. If your eyes have 0 hit points, you are blinded.

### Risking Your Eyes
If your eyes are at 0 hit points, you can risk pushing your limits further to use your technique. While you use your technique while blinded due to your eyes reaching 0 hit points, you take 5 psychic damage for every cursed energy spent on the technique and an additional 4 psychic damage for every 1 rolled above your cursed energy DC to resist the technique. This psychic damage bypasses cursed armor.

### Eye of the Beholder
At 10th level, due to the constant strain on your eyes, they become tougher and more durable. Your eyes' hit points increase to 1/2 of your maximum hit points (rounded up).

In addition, whenever your eyes' hit points reach 0, you can make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a success, your eyes' hit points are reduced to 1 instead.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all uses on a short or long rest.

## Level 1: Paralyzing Sight (Lapse Technique)
You can paralyze people with your sight. As an action, by spending 3 cursed energy, you force a creature within your sight range to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they are stunned until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, they are not stunned.

## Level 3: Improved Eyes (Technique Improvement)
Your paralyzation becomes faster. 

You can now use your paralyzing sight as a bonus action, and you gain advantage on saving throws against being blinded.

## Level 6: Concentrated Paralyze (Technique Improvement)
You have learned how to make your paralyzation last for longer periods in exchange for standing still. 

When you use your Paralyzing Sight, you can pay an additional 3 cursed energy to enter a deep concentration state, making the creature become stunned for 1 minute. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw at the beginning of each of their turns, ending the condition earlier on a success. You count as concentrating, as if you were concentrating on a spell.

If the creature manages to break free before the duration ends, you suffer great backlash on your eyes. Your eyes lose 2 hit points for every 1 rolled above your cursed energy DC (minimum of 1) multiplied by the number of rounds it took for the creature to break free. For example, if they broke free after 5 rounds and rolled an 18 against your DC of 16, you would lose 10 eye hit points.

## Level 10: True Paralyzation (Technique Improvement)
Your technique has evolved to new heights. 

Creatures who fail your Paralyzing Sight saving throw are now paralyzed instead of stunned.

At 17th level, creatures also become paralyzed when you use Concentrated Paralyze.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - All Seeing Eye (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Youâ€™ve reached illumination while in Tokyo, creating an extension technique just for that. 

As a bonus action, by spending 10 cursed energy, an eye symbol appears on your forehead for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits while the eye is active:

- You gain advantage on Perception checks.
- Your sight range doubles.
- Your Paralyzing Sight feature is now a free action.

## Level 20: Perfect Sight (Technique Improvement)
You have perfected your technique, overcoming its weaknesses. 

You no longer suffer any detriment when using any of your technique features, and you become immune to the blinded condition.

## Technique Reversal: Hyperactive Sight
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

With your mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique, you have learned your cursed technique reversal. You have now obtained the ability to turn your Paralyzing Sight into Hyperactive Sight. 

As an action, by spending 5 cursed energy, you target a creature within your sight range and accelerate their system with your bare eyes. For the next minute, the creature affected by your Hyperactive Sight has its speed and number of reactions doubled, and it also gains a free action to take the Disengage or Dash action. You count as concentrating, as if you were concentrating on a spell, while maintaining this bonus.

After 1 minute has passed, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you gain one level of exhaustion, and you cannot use Hyperactive Sight against the same target for the next round. On a success, nothing happens.
