As a user of Pain Killer, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Pain Killer (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to prevent injuries from worsening. 

As a bonus action, you spend 1 cursed energy to make a star symbol with your hands and touch a creature within your reach. The creature no longer takes damage from the same source of damage, but only from that specific source. For example, if a creature is taking damage at the beginning of their turns, they will stop receiving that damage, but future damage from other sources will still affect them. If the damage comes from a condition, only the damage will stop, while the condition itself remains.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill, or expertise if you're already proficient.

## Level 3: Injury Efficiency (Technique Improvement)
You have learned to be more efficient with your cursed technique. 

You can now use Pain Killer on all creatures of your choice within your reach, and it is now a free action.

## Level 6: State Killer (Technique Improvement)
You have improved your technique, now allowing you to help against conditions. 

Whenever you use Pain Killer on a creature, they also lose one condition of your choice that is related to the damage you just stopped.

## Level 10: Last Minute Save (Extension Technique)
You have learned to stop wounds from worsening just in time, though even you are not perfect. 

As a reaction, you can spend 4 cursed energy when an ally within your reach suffers any type of damage (except psychic). You prevent the wound from getting worse, halving the total damage dealt. The creature affected by this technique also receives the benefits of Pain Killer. 

This reaction can only be used once per turn.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Death Saver (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned in Tokyo that your technique is not weak; it just needed a small push in the right direction. 

You can now use Pain Killer on creatures making death saving throws, causing them to stop rolling death saves until they regain or lose at least 1 hit point.

## Level 20: Pain Nullifier (Technique Improvement)
You have completely mastered your technique, becoming an almost perfect nullifier of pain. 

You can now use your reaction more than once per creature's turn, gaining additional reactions for that feature equal to your proficiency bonus. Additionally, you can now use Pain Killer at will.

## Technique Reversal: Pain Amplify
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Your mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique has granted you the ability to amplify the pain of others instead of nullifying it. 

As a reaction, you can spend up to X cursed energy (where X is your Charisma modifier) to amplify the damage a creature takes from an attack. You must be able to touch the creature for this technique to work. For each cursed energy you spend, the target will take an additional 2 damage dice. 

For example, if a creature is hit by an attack dealing 8d6 damage and you spend 2 cursed energy, they will take an extra 4d6 damage.
