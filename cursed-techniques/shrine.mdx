As a user of the Shrine, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Dismantle (Lapse Technique)
When you take the Attack action during your turn, you can spend cursed energy (minimum 1) up to half your Charisma modifier (rounded up) to replace one of your attacks with an invisible ranged cursed energy slash. 

When you do so, make a cursed energy attack roll against a creature within 100 meters of you. If the target cannot see invisible objects, this attack has advantage. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Slashing damage per cursed energy spent and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer the Bleeding condition. You can replace multiple attacks with *Dismantle*, but each additional use costs an extra 1 cursed energy, which does not affect its damage.

This feature cannot replace attacks granted by other features such as *Cursed Blast of Blows*.

The limit of cursed energy you can spend when using *Dismantle* increases as shown in the table below.

| Level | Maximum Spendable Cursed Energy |
|:--:|:-|
|  5 | Your Charisma modifier |
| 11 | Your Charisma modifier + half your Charisma modifier (rounded up) |
| 17 | Twice your Charisma modifier |
| 20 | Three times your Charisma modifier |

## Level 3: Grid Slash (Extension Technique)
You can increase the area of effect of your *Dismantle*. Whenever you use *Dismantle*, you can spend additional cursed energy (minimum 1) up to half of your Charisma modifier (rounded up) to affect everything in a line. 

The line extends 2 meters per cursed energy spent (maximum of 3 times the cursed energy spent), and has a width of 2 meters and a height of 10 meters. 

All creatures within the line must make a Dexterity saving throw or take the damage of your *Dismantle*. On a success, they take half as much damage.

The limit of cursed energy you can spend when using *Grid Slash* increases as shown in the table below.

| Level | Maximum Spendable Cursed Energy |
|:--:|:-|
|  5 | Your Charisma modifier |
| 11 | Your Charisma modifier + half your Charisma modifier (rounded up) |
| 17 | Twice your Charisma modifier |
| 20 | Three times your Charisma modifier |

## Level 6: Cleave (Lapse Technique)
As an action, or as part of the Attack action when targeting a creature you are grappling or an object, you can spend cursed energy (minimum 1) up to twice your Charisma modifier to make a melee weapon attack roll against a creature. 

On a hit, the target takes 1d12 Slashing damage per cursed energy spent and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer the Bleeding condition.

The cursed energy is not expended if you miss.

Additionally, when you use this feature and spend cursed energy, you will learn the amount of cursed energy required to reduce the target to 0 hit points from their current total, factoring in temporary hit points, damage reductions, resistances, immunities, and any other features that could directly affect the outcome. You also know if you cannot reduce the target to 0 hit points with this attack.

If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this feature, they are cleaved into various small pieces.

The limit of cursed energy you can spend when using *Cleave* increases as shown in the table below.

| Level | Maximum Spendable Cursed Energy |
|:--:|:-|
| 11 | Twice your Charisma modifier + half your Charisma modifier (rounded up) |
| 17 | Three times your Charisma modifier |
| 20 | Four times your Charisma modifier |

## Level 10: Spiderweb (Extension Technique)
You have developed an extension of your technique to shatter the battlefield. As part of using *Cleave* on the ground, you can spend additional cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier multiplied by two to turn the ground within a radius of 2 meter per amount of cursed energy spent into difficult terrain. 

When you do so, all creatures within range must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d12 Bludgeoning damage per cursed energy spent. On a success, they take half as much damage. On a failure, they are pushed 2-times-the-amount-spent meters away from you. The ground and structures within the affected area take the maximum amount of Slashing damage.

The limit of cursed energy you can spend when using *Spiderweb* increases as shown in the table below.

| Level | Maximum Spendable Cursed Energy |
|:--:|:-|
| 11 | Twice your Charisma modifier + half your Charisma modifier (rounded up) |
| 17 | Three times your Charisma modifier |
| 20 | Four times your Charisma modifier |

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Dismantle Maneuvers (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You've mastered your *Dismantle* technique and can add the following effects to it.

***False Slash.*** Whenever you cast *Dismantle*, you can choose to make it miss and gain advantage on the next two melee attacks you make during your turn.

***Hand of Slashing.*** As a free action for 4 cursed energy, you coat your hands in small slashes until the beginning of your next turn. For the duration, once per round, you can attempt to grab a melee weapon attack made against you. That attack roll is reduced by 5, and if it is less than your cursed energy DC, you successfully grab the attack, negating it completely and ending the attackerâ€™s current attack or multiattack action.

***Slash Skating.*** As a bonus action for 4 cursed energy, you coat your feet in slashes, allowing you to skate effortlessly for 1 minute. For the duration, your walking speed is doubled, and you ignore difficult terrain. You can end this effect at will (no action required).

***Slashing Body.*** As a bonus action for 10 cursed energy, you coat your entire body with slashes, creating a barrier that rends the air around you. For 1 minute, you reduce all damage taken, except for psychic and thunder damage, by an amount equal to your Jujutsu Sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. Additionally, whenever you make an unarmed strike during this duration, you deal an extra 1d8 slashing damage.

## Level 20: Furnace - Open
You have mastered the cooking process imbued within Shrine, allowing you to utter an incantation that creates an arrow of fire capable of incinerating everything in moments. 

As a full-turn action (which cannot be reduced except through binding vows), you can expend cursed energy up to five times your Charisma modifier to force all creatures within 1 meter of you to make a Dexterity saving throw. 

On a failed save, creatures take 2d10 fire damage per cursed energy spent and suffer *Second Degree* burns. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, they instead suffer *Third Degree* burns. 

On a successful save, they take half damage and receive *First Degree* burns. Creatures with *Evasion* avoid all effects on a successful save.

| Condition | Effects |
|:----------|:--------|
| First Degree Burn | The creature's skin becomes bright red and parts of it begin to swell. They have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws. |
| Second Degree Burn | The creature's skin becomes red and blisters begin to form on the affected area. They have disadvantage on Charisma checks. |
| Third Degree Burn | The creature's skin blackens, and a numbness spreads across it. The creature must make a single Constitution saving throw against the caster's DC or a DC determined by the DM. On a failure, the overwhelming pain causes the creature to fall prone and become unconscious for one hour. On a success, the creature resists the pain and remains unaffected. |

## Technique Reversal: Assemble
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Through your mastery of Reverse Cursed Technique, you have learned Shrine's reversal, allowing you to attach things with your technique rather than destroy them.

Whenever you take the Attack action, you can spend cursed energy up to three times your Charisma modifier to replace a *Dismantle* with an *Assemble*, using Dismantle's range. A creature or object targeted by *Assemble* regains 2d8 hit points for every 2 cursed energy spent. If their limbs are injured or worse, those limbs will regain twice as many hit points.

The limit of cursed energy you can spend when using *Assemble* increases, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Maximum Spendable Cursed Energy |
|:--:|:-|
| 17 | Four times your Charisma modifier |
| 20 | Five times your Charisma modifier |
