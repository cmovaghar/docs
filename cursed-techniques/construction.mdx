As a user of the Construction, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Cursed Energy Deficiency
Your technique is immensely powerful and versatile, but its efficiency is lacking. When using your Construction and Cursed Construction features, you must spend twice the usual amount of Cursed Energy, though it still counts as if you have only spent the original amount. This also applies when creating Liquid Metal, but not when using any features through it.

## Level 1: Construction (Lapse Technique)
You can create any object with your technique, as long as you can imagine it or have knowledge of it. As an action, you can spend 1 minute analyzing Material Substances of your choice within reach. Afterward, you must make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against a DC of 10 + 5 for each rarity level above common that the material has. On a success, you learn about the material and register it. On a failure, you do not learn about the material and may try again after an hour. You begin with knowledge of one Material Substance chosen by your DM.

You can know a number of materials equal to twice your Sorcerer level plus your proficiency bonus times your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You do not need to analyze weapons or objects; you can create them freely as long as you know the material.

When you analyze a substance, you learn all of its properties, including its functions, composition, size, weight, value, and special traits. For example, if you analyze copper, you would learn its conductive and antimicrobial properties, which you can then apply to your creations.

As an action, you can spend 2 Cursed Energy to create a non-magical tool, weapon, or object from a material you know. For every 5 pounds of weight a creation has, you must spend 1 additional Cursed Energy. You can use this ability up to a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You may spend up to your Charisma modifier + half your Charisma modifier at 3rd level, Charisma modifier added twice at 5th, Charisma modifier added twice + half your Charisma modifier at 11th, and Charisma modifier added three times at 17th.

When you create an object or weapon, it automatically possesses all the properties it would normally have. You may also choose to exclude any properties it might have (for example, you can create a Heavy Crossbow without the Heavy property). When creating a greatsword, it will naturally have the Heavy property. The property limit only applies when modifying an object—removing or adding properties beyond what it naturally possesses. You do not need to analyze an object's properties to create it, only the material used in its construction. An object or weapon can have as many additional properties as your proficiency bonus (meaning you cannot grant objects or tools more properties than your proficiency bonus allows). When removing a property from an object or weapon, it also counts toward this limit.

Your creations last indefinitely, disappearing only if you choose to dismiss them or if they are destroyed. You can have a number of creations equal to your Sorcerer level + your proficiency bonus at once. Once you reach this limit, you cannot create anything new until you have dismissed or destroyed one of your existing creations.

***Mixed Properties.*** At 5th level, you learn how to fuse the properties of one object with another, creating a new item. When you create an object using Object Construction, you can spend Cursed Energy as if you were creating additional objects. Instead, you apply properties of your choice from those objects to the one you are currently creating. Each property added costs 2 Cursed Energy.

You can add up to a number of properties equal to your Charisma modifier. You cannot add the Light property to a weapon with the Heavy property, or vice versa.

***Cursed Infused Analysis.*** At 11th level, you develop a method to enhance your analysis by infusing your brain with Cursed Energy. Once per round, for 10 Cursed Energy, you may automatically succeed on the Investigation check to analyze a material substance.

***Biological Properties.*** At 17th level, through intense study, you learn how to extract properties from the bodies of dead creatures. You can now analyze any creature (excluding Humanoids and Undead) that has been dead for no more than a week, noting their features and properties. The time it takes depends on the size of the creature.

- Tiny (1 minute)
- Small (10 minutes) 
- Medium (1 hour) 
- Large (4 hours) 
- Huge (8 hours)
- Gargantuan (16 hours)

After fully analyzing a creature, you learn all of its traits and features. While you cannot create the creature itself out of Cursed Energy, you can imbue one of its traits into one of your creations. You may imbue passive traits, such as Pact Tactics, into armor while creating it. For features like attacks, you can imbue them into a weapon, adding the attack’s damage to the weapon's total (this can only be done once per weapon).

## Level 1: Battle Construction (Technique Improvement)
You have learned how to create weapons more quickly, allowing you to better adapt to the flow of combat. You can now use Construction as a bonus action. While attacking with a ranged weapon, you can create ammunition for that weapon as part of the attack. At 6th level, you can also use Cursed Construction as a bonus action.

Additionally, you are considered proficient with any weapons or armor you create using your Innate Technique.

***Quick Thoughts.*** At 5th level, you improve your ability to analyze things with your mind, gaining results much faster than before. You now take half the time to perform any analysis with your technique, and the time it takes to analyze again after failing the check is also halved.

## Level 6: Cursed Construction (Technique Improvement)
Your ability to create objects and weapons expands, allowing you to infuse Cursed Energy into your creations to turn them into Cursed Tools. You gain the ability to create Grade 4 and Grade 3 Cursed Tools, with each costing 4 Cursed Energy to create (this cost replaces the 2 Cursed Energy base cost for Construction). At 11th level, you gain the ability to create Grade 2 and Grade 1 Cursed Tools. Every special "effect" or "ability" a Cursed Tool possesses counts toward your property limit.

Additionally, you can now analyze materials mid-combat. As a bonus action, for 1 Cursed Energy, you may attempt to analyze a material within your reach. If you succeed, you can create objects from that substance. If you fail, you cannot analyze a substance for the rest of the round, and this is not affected by Quick Thoughts.

## Level 10: Liquid Metal (Extension Technique)
You have learned how to create Liquid Metal, a substance with a fluid form and changeable volume, yet stable physical properties due to semi-autonomous Cursed Energy. As a bonus action, for 5 Cursed Energy, you can create Liquid Metal anywhere within 3 meters of you, allowing it to float ahead, around, above, or below you for 1 minute. You can use the Construction and Cursed Construction features through Liquid Metal, with its total Cursed Energy cost halved (rounded down, to a minimum of 1). Once per round, you may choose to use the Construction and Cursed Construction features with no action required.

Melee weapons and objects created in this manner have a maximum reach of 20 meters, while ranged weapons and objects have their effective range increased by 20 meters. Additionally, whenever you attack with these weapons or objects at this increased reach/range, their damage die tier increases by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). (1d8 → 1d10 → 1d12 → 2d6)

These additional traits are only active while Liquid Metal is active.

At 14th level, you can reduce the cost of Insect Armor. At 20th level, you gain True Sphere features as per the reduction of Liquid Metal.

Lastly, while Liquid Metal is active, you can use the following techniques:

- ***Liquid Tendril.*** As an action, for 3 Cursed Energy per tendril, you can transform your Liquid Metal into small tendrils. Make a ranged Cursed Energy attack roll against up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) targets within 10 meters of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage. This damage increases to 3d6 at 11th level, 6d6 at 17th level, and 10d6 at 20th level.
- ***Liquid Spike.*** As an action, for 8 Cursed Energy, you can throw your Liquid Metal towards your opponents, causing it to explode into a spike ball. Choose a spot within 20 meters of you. All creatures within a 30-foot radius of the spike must make a Dexterity saving throw as the spike ball expands near them. On a failure, they take 5d6 piercing damage and must then make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, they take half as much damage. On a failure, the creature begins bleeding. On a success, they suffer no additional conditions. This technique's damage increases to 7d6 at 11th level, 10d6 at 17th level, and 14d6 at 20th level.
- ***Liquid Maiden.*** As an action, for 10 Cursed Energy, you snake your liquid around your opponent, trapping and injuring them. Choose a creature within 10 meters of you. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 5d6 piercing damage and then must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure of the Strength save, the creature becomes restrained. On a success of the Dexterity save, they take half as much damage and are not restrained. On a success of the Strength save, after failing the Dexterity save, the creature is no longer restrained. The creature can attempt the Strength save at the beginning of each of its turns to end the effect early. This technique's damage increases to 7d6 at 11th level, 10d6 at 17th level, and 14d6 at 20th level.
- ***Liquid Forest.*** As an action, for 10 Cursed Energy, you can attempt to entrap opponents in a dense weave of liquid metal pillars. Choose a point within 10 meters of you. Creatures within a 1-meter radius of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they are restrained. On a success, they may move up to their speed to exit the radius and avoid being restrained, as you create a structure of pillars filling the area. Creatures restrained within the structure have 3/4 cover (except against you) and may only target the structure, not anyone outside it. The structure’s AC is equal to your Cursed Energy DC, and it has hit points equal to your proficiency bonus times your Charisma score. If the structure is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and all creatures within it are released.

Finally, any creature restrained by the structure can make a Strength saving throw at the beginning of their turn to escape. On a success, they leave the radius and reduce the structure’s hit points by their Strength score.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Semi-Autonomous Cursed Energy Control (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned to draw inspiration from Liquid Metal’s ability to seamlessly shift between fluidity and solidity through semi-autonomous Cursed Energy control. You have refined your technique to achieve the same effortless adaptability in its normal application.

When you use your Construction or Cursed Construction features to create a weapon, you can spend additional Cursed Energy up to your Charisma modifier (this cost is unaffected by Cursed Energy deficiency) to create the system within the weapon. When you do, you may make ranged Cursed Energy attacks with the weapon instead of its usual attack method. These attacks have a range equal to the weapon’s long range for a normally ranged weapon, or 6 meters per Cursed Energy spent for a normally melee weapon. You can also control the trajectory midair, allowing these Cursed Energy attacks to ignore cover. Additionally, they remain suspended in the air for a number of rounds equal to the amount of Cursed Energy spent, enabling you to continue attacking with them as part of replacing an attack in the Attack action.

***Cursed Recycle.*** Due to the semi-autonomous Cursed Energy control system imbued within the items you've created, you've learned how to recycle the Cursed Energy spent in their creation to make another item. As a bonus action, you can use your Construction or Cursed Construction feature through the item. When doing so, half of the Cursed Energy spent to create the original item is treated as if it were spent alongside the normal cost for creating the new one. In this case, the previous item transforms into the newly created object.

## Level 20: True Sphere (Extension Technique)
You have created the impossible: a perfectly round sphere with no contact area, generating infinite pressure. As a rooting, distracting action for 30 Cursed Energy, while Liquid Metal is active, you can create a large black sphere within 10 meters of you that floats slightly above the ground. You may spend your bonus action to move the sphere anywhere within 20 meters of its original location.

If the sphere passes through any creature's space while it moves, or ends its turn in a creature's space, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw with advantage. On a failure, the creature takes 30d12 force damage and 30d12 bludgeoning damage, and is knocked prone and incapacitated until the beginning of your next turn. On a success, they take half as much damage and are not knocked prone or incapacitated. If they fail by 3 or more, they are stunned until the beginning of your next turn instead of being incapacitated. If they fail by 5 or more, they are paralyzed until the beginning of your next turn instead of being stunned.

You can only have one True Sphere active at a time, and it lasts for 1 minute before disappearing.

## Technique Reversal: Destruction
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

With great mastery over the Reversed Cursed Technique, you have discovered the reversal of your power. You have learned how to destroy objects and gain Cursed Energy from this destruction. Either as an action, bonus action, or reaction, you may channel your Cursed Technique Reversal to destroy an object. Choose one non-magical or Cursed Energy-filled object within reach that you vaporize from existence upon touching it. You must expend Cursed Energy depending on the size of the object, requiring 1 Cursed Energy for a tiny object, 2 Cursed Energy for a small object, 4 Cursed Energy for a medium object, and 8 Cursed Energy for a large object.

If you destroy a Cursed Tool that you created with the Construction or Cursed Creations feature, you will regain Cursed Energy equal to half the Cursed Energy you expended to create it (rounded down).

Additionally, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to attempt to destroy a magical or Cursed Energy-filled object, provided you succeed on a Charisma check. The DC for a common magical item or semi-grade Cursed Tool is 5. The DC for an uncommon magical item or grade 3 Cursed Tool is 10. The DC for a rare magical item or grade 2 Cursed Tool is 15. The DC for a very rare magical item or grade 1 Cursed Tool is 20. The DC for a legendary magical item or special grade Cursed Tool is 25.
