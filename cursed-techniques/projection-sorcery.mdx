As a user of Projection Sorcery, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Projection Sorcery (Lapse Technique)
You learn the Projection Technique, which allows you to divide 1 second into 24 frames, making you move faster. 

As a full-turn action for 4 Cursed Energy, you can split your turn into 24 frames, allowing you to predetermine your actions for the turn. The following is a list of actions you can take and the frame amount needed to carry out each action:

|Action|Frame Amount|Description|
|:-|:-:|:-|
|Movement|1 Frame|You may move 3 meters in a direction of your choice. If you pick this frame multiple times, the maximum amount of meters you may move is equal to your speed. If you try to move faster than this you fall under the 24 FPS Rule.|
|Attack|4 Frames|You may make 1 attack roll against a creature of choice.|
|Action|12 Frames|You may make 1 action. You cannot make 2 actions with this feature.|
|Bonus Action|4 Frames|You may make 1 bonus action. You cannot make the same bonus action more than 2 times with this feature.|
|Free Action|2 Frames|You may make 1 free action.|
|Reaction|2 Frames|You may make a reaction. You must still predetermine the trigger for this reaction or it will be wasted.|

While under the effects of Projection Sorcery, you cannot use actions obtained by spending frames to activate Projection Sorcery again. All of the actions you take in this manner act as readied actions but do not cost reactions to use. All actions you take during the 24 frames happen off of your turn in a manner you predetermine. When using a readied action that is later in the sequence than the next one you have queued, you must use those actions immediately and sequentially in order to use the action you're attempting to use. (For example, if you have 4 different actions queued, you can react to the 3rd trigger's action provided that you immediately use the 1st and 2nd queued actions, even if they're attacks and nobody is in range). You automatically take any unused readied actions at the end of the turn of the creature that goes just before you in the initiative.

When you use the readied actions gained from this feature, the readied action may interrupt the trigger when you use it, potentially causing the trigger to fail or not complete in some way. (For example, if a person uses an action for a feature that requires physical movement, like Piercing Blood needing two hands to use, you could interrupt that trigger, potentially causing it to fail and not activate, or if a person tries moving away, this could interrupt their movement, possibly causing them to stay put).

The weakness of this cursed technique is that while it is active, you can only act in the predetermined way that you set. Otherwise, you will fall under the 24 FPS Rule.

You must spend 2 cursed energy and a full-turn action at the beginning of your turns to keep this cursed technique active.

### Momentum Damage 
For every 6 meters you move while this technique is active, your next melee weapon attack or unarmed strike deals additional bludgeoning damage equal to your Charisma modifier. The bonus damage can only be applied a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus multiplied by your Charisma modifier to the same attack. 

Additionally, if you move 40 meters or more and land a successful momentum attack, the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they are knocked back by a distance equal to one-quarter of the distance you moved before hitting them, in a direction of your choice. If the creature collides with an unsecured object or structure, both the creature and the unsecured object or structure receive 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 3 meters the creature had left to travel after colliding with the surface. If the target is another creature, they both take damage equal to half of your damage roll (rounded down). On a success, the target is not moved.

If a creature successfully hits you while this technique is active, and you had moved toward that creature immediately before their attack, any additional damage gained from this feature is instead added to their damage roll.

## Level 3: Acceleration (Technique Improvement)
Your mastery of your cursed technique increases, and so does your speed. For every consecutive turn you have Projection Sorcery active, your speed increases by 6 meters.

Additionally, you have become invisible to the naked eye, making it almost impossible for the average person to dodge your attacks. While Projection Sorcery is active, you gain the following benefits: Whenever you take the Attack action against a creature whose passive Wisdom (Perception) is lower than your Cursed Energy DC, all of your attacks are made with advantage. If their passive Wisdom (Perception) is higher than your Cursed Energy DC, you attack normally. Furthermore, because your speed is so hard to track, your movement acts as teleportation to creatures with a passive Wisdom (Perception) lower than your Cursed Save DC, meaning you do not provoke opportunity attacks from them.

## Level 6: 24 FPS Rule (Lapse Technique)
You have learned how to affect creatures with the 24 FPS Rule, making them become stuck in one frame of animation. 

Once per turn, while your cursed technique is active, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you may choose to deal no damage by spending 4 Cursed Energy. The creature hit is forced to make an Intelligence saving throw.

On a failure, they are stuck in one frame of animation, becoming paralyzed until the beginning of their next turn. On a success, nothing happens. While affected by the 24 FPS Rule, the creature is considered an object with its size, and it becomes a mere panel of animation. You or another creature may hold this panel of animation, which weighs absolutely nothing.

The creature loses its paralyzed condition early if it takes damage from an outside source. Additionally, this damage can be reacted to by a creature in a frame.

## Level 10: Improved 24 FPS Rule (Technique Improvement)
You have studied the 24 FPS Rule, becoming a master at executing it. 

While your cursed technique is active, you can use the "24 FPS Rule" as a reaction against being targeted by a melee attack. This causes you and the creature to make a contested attack roll against each other. If the creature wins, they attack you as normal. If you win the contest, the creature falls under the effects of the 24 FPS Rule and must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, they are stuck in a frame as per the 24 FPS Rule.

Additionally, as a reaction to being targeted by a ranged attack roll or being forced to make a saving throw against something you can touch, you may make an attack roll. If your attack roll is higher than the original attack roll or saving throw, you trap the part of the attack that would hit you in frames, rendering it ineffective. The rest of the attack would still hit other creatures within range.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Consecutive Air Frames (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

After countless hours of training, you've developed the ability to expand the concept of what can be frozen with your technique, now being able to freeze and grasp even the air. 

While Projection is active, when you make an unarmed strike, you can spend Cursed Energy up to your proficiency bonus to increase the strike's reach by 3 meters for every Cursed Energy spent. When used this way, your unarmed strike's damage type changes to force damage and still benefits from the Momentum Damage feature.

Additionally, your unarmed strike’s attack roll affects creatures within a radius of the target equal to 1 meter for every Cursed Energy spent. If your roll hits any of these creatures, they take half the damage of your unarmed strike. You cannot use the 24 FPS feature or the Black Flash feat alongside this ability.

## Level 20: The Fastest Sorcerer (Technique Improvement)
Due to your advanced studies, you can now reach a higher speed level than any sorcerer ever could. While your cursed technique is active, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain +10 meters to your walking speed at the beginning of your turns.
- The frame cost of actions is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.
- Your momentum damage is now equal to 1.5 times your Charisma modifier (rounded down).

## Technique Reversal: Replay Sorcery
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have mastered the Reverse Cursed Technique and the 24 FPS rule, learning how to rewind time itself. 

As a Full Turn Action, you can activate Replay Technique by spending 8 Cursed Energy. Once activated, you can spend frames during your turn or in reaction to events to rewind a creature’s last action, movement, or effect, sending them or yourself back in time and undoing recent changes.

Any rewind requires the target creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, their action or movement is undone.

|Action|Frame Amount|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Replay (Self)|6 Frames|As a Bonus Action or Reaction, you rewind your own last action or reaction, undoing its effects (e.g., healing damage dealt to yourself, reversing a failed attack, etc.). No saving throw is required.|
|Replay (Target)|6 Frames|As a Bonus Action or Reaction, you rewind the last action or reaction of a creature within 10 meters. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw or have their action undone.|
|Replay Movement|1 Frame per 3 m.|As a Bonus Action or Reaction, you rewind the movement of a creature within 10 meters, rewinding them by 10 ft for every frame spent. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw or be returned to a position they occupied earlier in their turn, up to the total distance rewound.|
|Replay Effect|8 Frames|As an Action or Reaction, you rewind an effect (e.g., a spell or ongoing ability) caused by a creature within 10 meters. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw or have the effect completely negated and undone.|
|Replay Group|12 Frames|As a Full Action, you rewind the last actions, reactions, or movement of a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) within 3 meters of each other. Each creature must make an Intelligence saving throw or have their actions undone.|

Replay actions must be predetermined when activating Replay Technique. During your turn, allocate the required frames for each Replay action and specify their intended use. For example, if you allocate 6 frames for Replay (Target) and 4 frames for Replay Reaction, those frames cannot be reassigned to other actions if Replay is not triggered.

For Replay Reaction, you must predetermine the specific trigger (e.g., "an attack targeting me"). If the condition is not met, the frames and associated Cursed Energy are wasted.

Replay can only undo actions, reactions, or effects from the current or previous round of combat. Actions or effects that occurred earlier, ongoing cumulative effects, or actions taken by creatures outside of your range cannot be affected.

Each successive use of Replay in the same combat increases temporal strain. After the first use, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to avoid rewinding your own actions instead. The DC starts at 10 and increases by 2 for every additional use. This DC resets after a long rest.

You must spend 4 Cursed Energy and a full turn action at the beginning of your turns to keep this cursed technique active.
