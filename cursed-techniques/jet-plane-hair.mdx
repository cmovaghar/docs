As a user of the Jet Plane Hair, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Jet Plane Hair (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to transform your hair into a jet plane, granting you the ability to fly. 

As a bonus action, you can spend 2 Cursed Energy to gain flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute. While flying with this technique, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action. 

At the end of the minute, you can spend 1 additional Cursed Energy to continue flying for 1 more minute.

## Level 3: Boost (Technique Improvement)
You have learned to harness the full impulse of your technique, propelling yourself even faster and destroying anything in your path. 

When you take the Dash action, you can spend an additional 2 Cursed Energy to triple your movement speed instead of doubling it. If you choose Kyoto's Dash option, your movement speed quadruples instead of tripling.

While dashing this way, if you pass by a creature, they must make a Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage, unless their passive perception is equal to or higher than your Cursed Energy DC, in which case they roll normally. On a failed save, they take 1d4 bludgeoning damage for every 1 meter you have traveled before crashing into them. On a successful save, they take half the damage and you continue flying without issue. You take half as much damage from the impact, as you are also part of the collision.

If the creature fails the saving throw, they must also make a Strength saving throw. On a failed Strength save, they are pushed back until you reach the limit of your flying speed. On a successful save, they are knocked prone and your movement ends.

You deal twice as much damage against objects and structures when using this feature.

The damage cannot exceed a number of dice higher than your proficiency bonus times your Charisma modifier. At 5th level, the d4s become d6s. At 11th level, the d6s become d8s. At 17th level, the d8s become d10s. At 20th level, the d10s become d12s.

## Level 6: Free Bird (Technique Improvement)
Like a free bird, you can soar through the sky at incredible speeds.

While flying with Jet Plane Hair, you no longer provoke opportunity attacks, and your flying speed is now twice your walking speed.

## Level 10: All Out (Extension Technique)
You have created a powerful yet dangerous extension of your technique, blinding yourself for maximum damage.

As an action, you can spend 8 Cursed Energy to move in a straight line equal to four times your movement speed. All creatures in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage unless their passive perception is equal to or higher than your Cursed Energy DC, in which case they roll normally.

On a failed save, the creatures take your current Boost damage and are pushed back until you reach the limit of your flying speed. On a successful save, they take half the damage and are not pushed back. You take the same amount of damage from the attack, as you are also part of the impact. The damage from this impact overcomes resistances.

This techniqueâ€™s damage deals quadruple the normal amount against objects and structures.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Wind Tornado (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have created an extension technique that harnesses your propulsion to create a devastating tornado. 

As an action, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to choose a point within your flying speed range and fly over to that point. All creatures within a 10-meter cylinder of that area must make a Strength saving throw.

On a failed save, they take 20d8 bludgeoning damage and are pulled 10 meters into the air, instantly falling at the end of your turn. On a successful save, they take half the damage and are not pulled into the air. You end this technique 1 meter away from the area where the tornado occurred.

At 17th level, the damage increases to 26d8, and at 20th level, the damage increases to 34d8.

## Level 20: War Jet (Technique Improvement)
Your hair has evolved into a war jet, turning it into a much more effective weapon. 

Your walking speed now triples when converted into flying speed, and the damage of the Boost and All-Out features now deals force damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

## Technique Reversal: Submarine Hair
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Because you have mastered Reverse Cursed Technique, you can now use your Cursed Technique Reversal to transform your hair into a submarine. 

As a bonus action, you can spend 4 Cursed Energy to gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute. While swimming with this technique, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action. At the end of the minute, you can spend 1 additional Cursed Energy to continue swimming for 1 more minute. Additionally, the air within your hair allows you to breathe underwater for an amount of time equal to your Charisma modifier in minutes.

You cannot have both your Lapse and Reversal activated at the same time. You may only have one active at a time, and you can swap between them by paying the activation cost.

As an action, while your Submarine Hair is active, you can shoot 2 missiles. Each missile travels in a 10-meter line and explodes into a 5-meter circle at the end. Each creature within one of the circles must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 4d8 fire damage. On a successful save, they take half as much damage.
