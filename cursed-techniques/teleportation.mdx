As a user of Teleportation, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Teleportation (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to teleport to destinations you have marked. 

You begin with a white sheet, which you use to cover yourself for teleportation. 

As a bonus action for 1 Cursed Energy, you may place a mark by touching a person, location, or object. You can have a number of simultaneous marks equal to twice your Charisma modifier.

A mark will remain marked for up to 12 hours. You can unmark something at will.

As an action for 2 Cursed Energy, you can cover yourself and any creature within 1 meter of you. All covered creatures are teleported up to 150 meters to a marked location.

## Level 3: Improved Teleport (Technique Improvement)
You have improved your technique. 

The range of your teleport now increases to (your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus + your Jujutsu Sorcerer level) × 30 meters. 

Additionally, you can now use the teleport as a reaction to an attack or saving throw, as long as you're holding the sheet.

## Level 6: Mastered Teleport (Technique Improvement)
With great training, you have reached the pinnacle of your teleportation technique. 

As an action for 10 Cursed Energy, you can use Teleportation without any range restrictions. You can only go to marks you have already made with this teleport.

Additionally, your markings now last for a week instead of 12 hours.

## Level 10: Improved Marking (Technique Improvement)
You have learned to mark things more efficiently. 

You can now mark a target as a free action instead of a bonus action, and the number of markings you can have is increased to three times your Charisma modifier.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Stay Behind (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You are now able to teleport others without teleporting yourself. 

When using any teleport feature, you can choose to teleport only other creatures while remaining in place. 

Additionally, if the teleport is used on an unwilling creature, they must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they are teleported; on a success, they remain where they are.

## Level 20: Perfected Teleport (Technique Improvement)
You have grown more efficient with your teleports and perfected their usage. 

The action cost for your teleports is reduced by one step (full turn action → action → bonus action → free action).

Additionally, your markings now last for one month.

## Technique Reversal: Grounding
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You have mastered Reverse Cursed Technique and unlocked your Cursed Technique Reversal. You can now force enemies to stay still by reversing your technique. 

As a bonus action for 2 Cursed Energy, you can cover an enemy within melee range with your sheet, forcing them to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, their speed is reduced to 0 for 1 minute. On a success, they are unaffected. A creature that fails can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
