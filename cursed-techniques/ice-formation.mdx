As a user of Ice Formation, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Cold Cursed Energy
Your cursed energy is as cold as a blizzard in the harsh winter. 

When you use Curse-Empowered Strikes, Cursed Strikes, or Cursed Weapon Enhancement, you can choose to change the damage type to cold instead of necrotic damage. Additionally, whenever you use Cursed Armor, you gain resistance to cold damage.

You are also immune to the effects of [extreme cold](https://dnd-5e.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Cold), whether magical or not. Furthermore, whenever someone grapples you while you're using Cursed Armor, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer the effects of [extreme cold](https://dnd-5e.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Cold).

***Created Ice***. Whenever you utilize your technique, you create varying quantities of ice that occupy the same space it was used in. For example, if you use a 5 meters cone, it will cover a 5 meters cone of ice and will be 5 meters in height.

Any ice created by you has an amount of hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) times your Jujutsu Sorcerer level. Its AC is equal to your Cursed Energy DC. The size of the ice is the same as the size of the creature caught in it, with its size increasing by one for each creature affected by it. It is vulnerable to fire and bludgeoning damage, immune to psychic and poison damage, and if it receives cold damage, it regains an equal amount of hit points instead.

Creatures reduce your ice's maximum hit points by ¼ of their maximum when they break out of it.

All ice created by your technique lasts until you end it at will (no action required), it is reduced to 0 hit points, or you are affected by the [poisoned](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Poisoned), [envenomed](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Envenomed), [paralyzed](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Paralyzed), [stunned](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Stunned), [petrified](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Petrified), or [unconscious](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Unconscious) conditions.

## Level 1: Ice Formation (Lapse Technique)
Your innate technique allows you to manipulate the temperature around you, creating extreme cold that you can use to partially freeze others. 

As an action, you can spend 2 cursed energy to make a ranged cursed energy attack roll against a creature within 3 meters of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 cold damage and must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, they are restrained as ice covers part of their body. On a successful save, they break free from the ice and avoid being restrained.

After the Strength saving throw, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they become [chilled](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Chilled). On a success, they avoid becoming Chilled. If they fail by 5 or more, they also become [Half Frozen](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Frozen).

The creature makes a new Strength saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns, breaking out of the ice on a success. If the target failed their Constitution saving throw, they may only begin making their Strength saving throws after escaping your ice.

At 5th level, this technique’s damage increases to 2d10; at 11th level, it increases to 4d10; at 17th level, it increases to 7d10; and at 20th level, it increases to 11d10.

## Level 3: Cold Environment (Technique Improvement)
Being trapped in your ice feels like being stranded in a freezing mountain, with death slowly and painfully closing in. 

Whenever a creature is within at least X meters of ice created by your innate technique (where X is twice your Charisma modifier, minimum of 1), they may suffer the following side effects of a cold environment:

***Extreme Cold.*** The creature experiences the effects of extreme cold, with the DC now being your cursed energy DC. These effects occur at the end of each round. If they fail by 5 or more, they become Chilled. Once they leave the area of your ice, they can attempt to remake the Constitution saving throw at the beginning of their turns to end the condition.

***Freezing Winter.*** Starting at 5th level, any creature within range of your ice that doesn't have cold resistance or immunity has their movement speed reduced by X meters, where X is your Charisma modifier multiplied by 3.

***Frozen Coffin.*** At 11th level, creatures have disadvantage on Strength saving throws to escape your ice, unless their Strength score is higher than your cursed energy DC.

***Cold Death.*** At 17th level, whenever a creature takes cold damage from being frozen or half frozen by your innate technique, the damage is maximized.

A creature can only suffer these effects from one instance of your ice at a time, even if multiple ice areas are within range.

## Level 6: Ice Fall (Extension Technique)
You have developed an extension technique that serves as a deadly execution method. 

As an action, you spend 6 cursed energy to crouch and create ice on the ground. You then telepathically manipulate the ice, launching one shard for each creature of your choice within 10 meters of you. Make a ranged cursed energy attack roll for each target. On a hit, the creature takes 6d10 cold damage, becomes restrained by the ice, and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they also become [Half Frozen](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Frozen). On a successful save, they suffer no additional effects. If they fail by 5 or more, they become [Frozen](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Frozen) instead.

The creature can make a Strength saving throw at the beginning of its turns to break free from the restraint, ending the condition on a success.

Whether you hit or miss, giant spikes of ice fall from the sky, targeting the creatures you aimed at. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 6d8 piercing damage; on a successful save, they take half as much damage.

At 11th level, this technique's damage increases to 10d10 + 10d8. At 17th level, it increases to 16d10 + 16d8, and at 20th level, it increases to 24d10 + 24d8.

## Level 10: Frost Calm (Extension Technique)
You have learned how to unleash thick layers of ice through mist by breathing it through your hand. 

As an action, you spend 10 cursed energy to release a cloud of freezing mist. Choose a point within 20 meters of you. All creatures in a 10-meter by 10-meter square within that area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, they take 8d12 cold damage and are both restrained and Half Frozen by the ice layer that forms in the area. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and are neither restrained nor Half Frozen.

After making the Strength saving throw, each creature must also make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they become [Frozen](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Frozen) if they failed the Strength saving throw, or [Half Frozen](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Frozen) if they succeeded. On a successful Constitution save, they do not suffer any additional effects.

The creature can remake the Strength saving throw at the beginning of its turns, breaking free from the ice on a success.

At 11th level, the damage of this technique increases to 11d12. At 17th level, it increases to 15d12, and at 20th level, it increases to 20d12.

When you use Maximum Output with this technique, the range increases to 90 meters, and it now targets all creatures of your choice within a 30-meter radius.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Telepathic Connection (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned to extend the range of your abilities. 

Whenever part of your ice is within 30 meters of you, you can use any of your features from that range as if you were present at the location of the ice.

Creatures with a passive perception lower than your cursed energy DC make their saving throws with disadvantage. Additionally, your ranged cursed energy attack rolls are made with advantage, as the creatures cannot predict the timing of your attacks.

## Level 20: Freezing Hell (Extension Technique)
In combat, it feels as if an ice age has descended. 

Cold damage caused by you ignores resistances, though it still does not bypass immunities. Additionally, your ice is no longer vulnerable to fire damage.

Furthermore, whenever a creature breaks free from your ice, they take piercing damage equal to your Charisma modifier, with the amount adjusted depending on their size.Extension Technique)

## Technique Reversal: Heat Dissociation
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Due to your mastery of Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked the ability to enhance the heat in the air, causing creatures to boil alive. 

As an action, you spend 4 cursed energy to force a number of targets, up to your Charisma modifier, within 10 meters of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 8d10 fire damage and gain one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and avoid gaining exhaustion.

Any damage dealt by this technique also reduces the target's maximum hit points, as their blood boils into the air. The lost hit points are regained after the target takes a long rest.

At 17th level, this technique's damage increases to 14d10 fire damage, and at 20th level, it increases to 22d10 fire damage.

This technique deals twice as much damage to objects and structures.
