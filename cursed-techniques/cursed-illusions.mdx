As a user of Cursed Illusions, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Cursed Illusions (Lapse Technique)
You have unlocked your lapse technique, which allows you to curse creatures and make them see other people's faces in a distorted way. You can also track those you have cursed. 

As an action, you can spend 4 cursed energy to curse a creature. Select one target within 20 meters of you. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the next person they see has a distorted face, and seeing this distortion forces the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, they become confused until the end of their next turn. On a success, they are not affected. 

After failing, a creature may repeat the saving throws at the end of their turns if they have at least 1 level of jujutsu sorcerer, or after 1 minute if they have no jujutsu sorcerer levels, to end the curse. If they pass the first save, they are not cursed.

Once a creature is cursed, your technique’s range increases to 120 meters. While cursed, you know the creature’s general location. The cursed creature will continue to see the distorted face until the curse ends, but they only need to make the save the first time they see the affected person. A creature may only stop being distorted by either leaving your range or passing the saving throw.

## Level 3: Self Distortion (Technique Improvement)
You’ve learned how to distort your own body to confuse your opponents. 

You gain the following three distortion techniques:

***Phase Fist.*** As part of making a melee attack, you may expend 3 cursed energy to create a duplicate of your weapon. Roll a melee cursed attack roll at disadvantage against a creature within reach. Afterward, you can make a melee attack against the same target. If the first attack misses, the second attack is made with advantage. If the first attack hits, the second attack deals double damage dice on hit.

***Blurring.*** As an action, you can spend 4 cursed energy to make your body blur, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, such as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, such as with true sight.

***Distorting Disguise.*** For 3 cursed energy, you can make yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings – look different for a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier. The changes are purely illusory and fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this technique to add a hat to your outfit, objects will pass through it, and anyone who touches it will feel your head and hair instead. If you use this technique to appear thinner than you are, anyone who reaches out to touch you will bump into your body as if the space around you was solid. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your cursed energy save DC.

## Level 6: Curse of Tracking (Extension Technique)
You have begun to refine your tracking skills, allowing you to know the exact location of your targets at all times, even beyond the illusions of your Lapse technique.

When someone is cursed by your Lapse technique, you can spend an additional 4 cursed energy to forgo the effects of the illusions and enhance the tracking. A mark appears somewhere on the target's body, hidden from their sight, and they can make an Investigation check against your Cursed Energy DC to become aware of the curse, or if someone else points it out. This mark lasts for 24 hours, and while it is active, you will always know the precise location of the target within a range of 120 meters plus an additional range equal to your Proficiency Bonus × 20.

At the beginning of each day, you can spend double the cursed energy you spent the previous day to keep the mark active for another 24 hours.

If the target leaves the range, it isn’t the end. If they return within the 24-hour period, the mark becomes active again. However, you cannot extend the mark into the next day unless the target is within range when you attempt to reactivate it.

At 9th level, you begin to learn more about your prey. When the curse becomes active, you can learn one piece of information about your target, such as their hit point maximum, a general description of their technique, or whether they lied when asked a certain question, etc. This increases to two pieces of information at 14th level and three at 20th level.

## Level 10: Object Distortion (Technique Improvement)
You have now learned a new way to distort the surroundings of those you have cursed.

As an action, you may choose an object within the range of your Lapse technique that you can see and distort its appearance. This may include changing its opacity, luster, visible texture, or perceived value. A creature may attempt to discern the illusion by rolling an Investigation check against your Cursed Energy save DC.

The cost of the technique depends on the size of the targeted object, as shown in the chart below:

|Size|Cursed Energy Requirement|
|:-:|:-:|
|Tiny|1|
|Small|3|
|Medium|5|
|Large|8|
|Huge|12|
|Gargantuan|16|

## Level 14: Tokyo Feature: Illusionary Terrain (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have determined that affecting the area around others can lead to a strategic advantage. 

As an action, you can spend 14 cursed energy to manipulate the surrounding terrain within a 30-meter radius in the following ways:

***Rough Ground.*** You create difficult terrain, causing creatures that attempt to move through the area to spend twice as much movement for every 1 meter of travel.

***Obstructing Illusion.*** You conjure a false structure or wall within the range, deceiving creatures into believing it is real. This prevents them from targeting you with abilities that require line of sight.

Creatures can attempt to see through the illusion by making an investigation check against your cursed energy save DC. A creature automatically succeeds if they have truesight.

## Level 20: Mental Illusion (Extension Technique)
Your technique has reached its pinnacle. 

Whenever a creature is affected by your lapse technique, you can expend an additional 10 cursed energy to manipulate the way the target perceives the world. 

While under this effect, you can create illusions that cost only 1 cursed energy, but they can only affect that specific creature. Any illusion you create cannot be recognized as false by the creature affected by this feature, as they perceive everything you create as reality.

This technique lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier.

## Technique Reversal: Illusion Materialization
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Through your mastery of Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked your cursed technique reversal. 

As an action, you can spend 4 cursed energy to distort a creature’s face, causing it to become twisted in a way that confuses cursed creatures. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, their face becomes distorted, and they become confused. 

After failing, the creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a success, they are not confused.
