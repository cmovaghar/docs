As a user of the Sky Manipulation, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Spatial Cursed Energy
Due to your constant manipulation of space, your cursed energy has been significantly altered. 

When you activate your Cursed Armor Enhancement, you gain resistance to force damage. 

Additionally, when you deal damage with the Curse-Empowered Strikes, cursed strikes, or Cursed Weapon Enhancement feature, you can choose to change the damage type to force damage.

## Level 1: Sky Manipulation (Lapse Technique)
Your innate technique manifests, allowing you to manipulate the sky around you. 

As a reaction to an attack roll, you can spend 3 Cursed Energy to add +4 to your AC by distorting the sky until the end of this turn.

If this technique causes a ranged attack to miss, you can make a ranged cursed energy attack roll against the attacker. On a hit, the target takes the attack's damage roll plus your Charisma modifier.

If this technique causes a melee weapon attack to miss, it renders the limb used in the attack useless, making it count as broken until the beginning of the creature's next turn.

If you have taken the Dodge action, you may use this reaction on creatures of your choice within your reach.

***Energy Redirection.*** At 5th level, you learn to redirect energy back at your opponents. You can now use this reaction when you are forced to make a cone or line saving throw, adding +4 to the roll. If you succeed, you and all other creatures within range are not affected, and you force all creatures within range to make the saving throw using your cursed energy DC. For example, if you were forced to make a line saving throw and succeed, you force all creatures in a line starting from you to make the saving throw.

## Level 3: Sky Cloth (Extension Technique)
You have become more proficient at manipulating the space around you. 

As a bonus action, you can spend 4 Cursed Energy to cover part of your body by grasping the sky like cloth, making the covered areas appear invisible for 1 minute.

While the sky cloth is covering you, your AC increases by your proficiency bonus, and attack rolls against you are made with disadvantage.

Once the minute ends, you can spend 1 Cursed Energy to extend the effect for 1 more minute.

***Sky Flight.*** At 5th level, your sky cloth allows you to become one with the sky. While under the effects of Sky Cloth, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover in the air. If an effect would reduce your movement speed to 0, you begin to fall.

***Spatial Landing.*** At 11th level, your sky cloth protects you from the harshest falls. As a reaction to falling while your sky cloth is activated, you can reduce the fall damage by 5 times your Jujutsu Sorcerer level.

***Spatial Distortion.*** At 17th level, while your sky cloth is activated, reaching you becomes an incredibly difficult task. You have advantage on cone or line saving throws while the sky cloth is in effect.

## Level 6: Sky Dashing (Improved Technique)
While in the sky, you are truly free as a bird. 

You do not provoke opportunity attacks when flying by a creature while using Sky Cloth. 

Additionally, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action while flying.

## Level 10: Thin Ice Breaker (Extension Technique)
You have developed an extension technique for your sky manipulation, literally breaking the sky as if it were a thin layer of ice. 

As an action, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to strike the sky with a powerful blow. Make a ranged cursed energy attack roll against a point within 20 meters of you. All creatures, objects, and structures within a 3-meter radius of that point are targeted by the attack roll. On a hit, they take force damage equal to the number of rolls of your unarmed strike die, based on your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), and must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, they are knocked prone and pushed back a distance of 3 meters times your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). On a successful save, they are not knocked prone and are pushed back half as far.

This technique deals twice as much damage to objects and structures.

At 11th level, you roll a number of unarmed strikes equal to your Charisma modifier plus half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down). This increases to your Charisma modifier plus twice your Charisma modifier at 17th level, and to your Charisma modifier plus three times your Charisma modifier at 20th level.

## Level 14: Tokyo Feature: Enhancing Thin Ice Breaker (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

Studying the basics of your technique at Tokyo, youâ€™ve realized your Thin Ice Breaker extension has much more potential than you initially thought. 

Whenever you make a melee weapon attack roll, you can spend 10 Cursed Energy to grant the attack advantage. On a hit, the attack's damage is changed to force damage and is considered a critical hit.

## Level 20: Untouchable Sky Guardian (Technique Improvement)
You become one with the sky, and nothing can hit you as you are protected by it. 

The AC and roll bonuses you gain with Sky Manipulation are increased to +6.

Additionally, while flying, you make ranged cursed energy attack rolls with advantage.

## Technique Reversal: Sky Deletion
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

With great mastery over the Reverse Cursed Technique, you have unlocked the reversal of your technique. Instead of bending and shaping the sky, you erase it entirely, making it seem as though it never existed in the first place. 

As an action, for 6 Cursed Energy, you choose a point within 20 meters of you. All creatures within a 6-meter radius of that point must make a Strength saving throw as you delete the space surrounding the area.

On a failure, a creature is pushed to the point and takes bludgeoning damage depending on the size and quantity of creatures it hits. On a success, the creature is still pushed, but they take half as much damage.

If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, they become confused until the beginning of your next turn.

A creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Charisma modifier multiplied by twice the number of creatures it hits. For every size category above Tiny, your Charisma modifier is added again.

Creatures smaller than Medium or with a Strength score lower than your Cursed Energy DC make the saving throw with disadvantage.
