As a user of the G Warstaff, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: G Warstaff (Lapse Technique)
You can summon a pen-like cursed tool that allows you to see into the future of your opponents. 

As a free action, you can create an oversized pen-like cursed tool called G Warstaff by spending 1 cursed energy. It has reach and is a two-handed weapon. You can use your Charisma modifier for its attack and damage rolls, and on a hit, it deals 1d4 + your Charisma modifier piercing damage. Additionally, it counts as a grade 4 cursed tool and as an unarmed strike. However, you cannot use the benefits of cursed strikes with G Warstaff. You can dismiss G Warstaff at will, and you can only have one G Warstaff created at a time.

Whenever you hit a creature with G Warstaff, you fulfill G Warstaff's condition for ink, attaching a manga panel to the target. This allows you to view 1 second into the target's future. Hitting the target multiple times adds an additional second to the total, granting you the benefits of the earlier seconds along with the current one.

As a reaction or bonus action, for 2 cursed energy, you can view into the target's future and gain the following benefits until the beginning of your next turn, depending on how many seconds you can currently see, as long as you are not blinded:
|Seconds|Benefit|
|:-:|-|
|1|The creature's attack rolls against you have disadvantage.|
|2|You have advantage on the creature's saving throws.|
|3|You have advantage on attack rolls against the creature.|
|4|At the start of the creature's turn, you know all the actions the creature will take on their next turn (your DM will tell you what the creature plans to do).|
|5|At the end of your turn, you know all the actions the creature will take on their next turn (your DM will inform you of what the creature plans to do before they act).|
|6|At the beginning of your turn, you know all the actions the creature will take on their next turn (your DM tells you what the creature will do before they act).|

You can see into a creature's future for a number of seconds equal to your proficiency bonus. The number of creatures you can affect with this technique is equal to your Charisma modifier. You may end the technique at will or when combat ends.

If you explain your cursed technique to the target, or if the target has been affected by your technique for more than two rounds, they can make an Insight check against your cursed energy DC. On a success, the following rule applies. On a failure, nothing happens. If your passive perception is lower than the target's cursed energy DC, you lose the benefits of future sight as they now target your blind spots.

You can use a bonus action to cover your blind spot, adding your proficiency bonus to your passive perception for this feature until the beginning of your next turn, positioning yourself to counterattack from your blind spots. If your passive perception becomes higher than the target's cursed energy DC, you regain the benefits of future sight, as you are once again able to confirm their actions with your eyes.

At 2nd level, G Warstaff now uses your martial arts die for damage rolls. At 5th level, G Warstaff becomes a Grade 3 cursed tool. At 11th level, it becomes a Grade 2 cursed tool. At 17th level, it becomes a Grade 1 cursed tool. At 20th level, it becomes a Special Grade cursed tool.

## Level 3: Predictable Attacks (Technique Improvement)
With the power of reading into the future, no one can surprise you anymore. 

As long as you can see 2 seconds into a creature's future, whenever you make a saving throw against an effect caused by that creature, you take half damage on a failure and no damage on a success.

## Level 6: Perfect Strike (Technique Improvement)
Your opponents become extremely easy to read after being affected by your technique, and you've learned how to exploit that. 

Once per turn, when you hit an attack with your G Warstaff against a creature you can see 3 seconds into the future, you can turn that attack into a critical hit.

## Level 10: Illuminated Actions (Technique Improvement)
While in battle, you are illuminated, knowing exactly what to do and when. 

Whenever you roll with advantage against a creature due to your technique, the feature's critical hit range is reduced by half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down). 

Additionally, whenever a creature rolls with disadvantage against you due to your technique, the range for critical failures is increased by half of your Charisma modifier (rounded down). 

For example, if your Charisma modifier is +4 and the creature rolls a natural 3, it counts as a critical failure.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - GG True Warstaff (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have created a more powerful version of your G Warstaff, transforming it into a true weapon of destruction. 

As a bonus action, while G Warstaff is active, you can spend 4 cursed energy to evolve it into its true form, GG True Warstaff. It gains the following benefits for 1 minute:

- It deals one additional damage die.
- Its reach increases to 5 meters instead of 3 meters.
- Whenever you score a natural critical hit against a creature, you gain 2 seconds of future sight instead of 1.
- Its critical hit range is expanded to 19-20.

## Level 20: The Enlightened One (Technique Improvement)
Your foresight ability has reached its maximum potential, and you are now considered enlightened. 

Whenever you have advantage due to your technique, you can roll 3 dice instead of 2 and keep the highest roll. 

Additionally, whenever a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you because of your technique, they roll 3 dice instead of 2 and keep the lowest roll.

## Technique Reversal: View Past
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

With your mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique comes your cursed technique reversal. 

Just like when using G Warstaff normally, you fulfill G Warstaff's condition for ink by hitting a creature. However, instead of seeing their future, you can see their past. 

As a bonus action, for 4 cursed energy, you can view their manga panel and learn the actions they took over the past few weeks. You can see a number of weeks in the past equal to the number of seconds stored in your G Warstaff.
