As a user of the Séance Technique, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Séance Technique (Lapse Technique)
You possess a very powerful and dangerous technique, and have begun to learn its basics. As a full-turn action for 3 cursed energy, you can shapeshift yourself or another creature into a dead humanoid with a CR or level no higher than 1 above your Jujutsu Sorcerer level. To perform this, you must have a small body part from the deceased humanoid, such as a finger, and you or the willing participant must consume it.

The shapeshifted creature loses all of its class features, except for cursed energy, and assumes the appearance, racial traits, features, saving throw proficiencies, and skill proficiencies of the deceased humanoid. The creature will also gain the same Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores as the deceased humanoid. The shapeshifted creature does not gain any spellcasting or cursed energy-related features.

The shapeshifter must spend 2 cursed energy at the beginning of its turns to maintain the form, with the technique ending once the shapeshifter's cursed energy runs out. This cannot be replenished with external cursed energy, such as from a Battery Binding Vow.

***Soul Information.*** You can choose to spend 3 additional cursed energy to summon the soul's information. The shapeshifter will gain access to the full knowledge and memories of the deceased body. While this can be useful, it is also risky. At the beginning of each of their turns, the shapeshifter must make a Charisma saving throw against the deceased person's DC (8 + proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier). On a failure, the humanoid's soul possesses the body and takes control until the shapeshifter's cursed energy runs out.

***Soul Seer.*** Your innate technique naturally allows you to see the outline of creatures' souls. You start with 1 soul knowledge.

If you or a willing creature attempt to shapeshift into a humanoid with levels in the Heavenly Restriction class, the soul information saving throw automatically fails. However, instead of lasting until the shapeshifter's cursed energy runs out, the possession will continue until the creature is reduced to 0 hit points.

## Level 3: Gatherer of the Dead (Technique Improvement)
While some may call you morbid, you have become exceptionally skilled at locating the corpses of the deceased. 

You gain proficiency in the Investigation skill, or expertise if you are already proficient, and you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks related to dead humanoids.

## Level 6: Ritual of Resurrection (Technique Improvement)
You have learned how to perform a prolonged ritual to enhance the power of your technique. 

When you use your technique on yourself or someone else, and one of you consumes a piece of DNA, you can instead begin a ritual rather than immediately shapeshifting. 

To perform the ritual, you must remain completely still for 1 minute, treating it as if you are concentrating on a spell. If you lose concentration during this time, the ritual stops, and you must start over. 

Upon completing the ritual, you or a willing creature can shift into the humanoid form, provided their CR or level is equal to or lower than your jujutsu sorcerer level plus your proficiency bonus.

## Level 10: Power of the Deceased (Technique Improvement)
You have evolved your technique to be capable of drawing in even stronger individuals than before. 

When you use the Ritual of Resurrection, you can choose to spend twice as much cursed energy to increase the maximum CR or level of the humanoid to no more than your jujutsu sorcerer level plus your proficiency bonus plus your Charisma modifier.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Willpower (Technique Improvement)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

You have learned how to maintain your own sorcerer powers while using your technique. 

You no longer lose your class features when using the Seánce technique. However, if you use it on others, they will still lose their class features.

## Level 20: Maximum Potential (Technique Improvement)
You have mastered the Séance technique, finally unlocking the full potential of the corpses. 

The shapeshifter will now also gain their spellcasting and cursed energy-related features, should they possess any.

Additionally, maintaining the technique now costs only 1 cursed energy.

## Technique Reversal: Full Control
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

You've reached the pinnacle of your mastery over the Séance technique, allowing you to perform a truly remarkable feat. You can now use your technique to allow other beings to become you. As a full-turn action for 8 cursed energy, you can shapeshift a willing creature into yourself. While the shapeshifter takes on your form, you gain control over them, with access to their soul information.

Your real body will remain in its original position, rendered unconscious during the process. The only benefit you gain from the shapeshifter is their cursed energy, and you must spend 2 cursed energy at the start of each of their turns to maintain control. If you fail to spend the cursed energy, you will return to your original body.
