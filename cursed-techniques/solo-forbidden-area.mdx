As a user of the Solo Forbidden Area, you gain the following features when you reach the specified levels.

## Level 1: Solo Forbidden Area (Lapse Technique)
Your technique allows you to enhance the output of those around you.

As an action, you can spend up to your Charisma modifier plus your proficiency bonus in Cursed Energy (minimum of 1) to use your technique, increasing the output of every creature of your choice within a 10-meter radius. All chosen creatures, including yourself, gain the following benefits until the beginning of your next turn:

- They gain temporary Cursed Energy equal to the amount spent (this does not apply to yourself).
- If they can spend additional Cursed Energy in a feature, they may spend an additional amount of Cursed Energy equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).
- They gain a range bonus equal to 4 times your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) for their Cursed Energy features. This does not apply to touch-based features.
- If any of their Cursed Energy features has a radius, it is increased by 10 times your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

## Level 3: Quickened Support (Technique Improvement)
You have developed a method to utilize your technique more quickly, though it reduces its effectiveness. 

You can now use Solo Forbidden Area as a bonus action instead of an action, but it only uses half of your Charisma modifier (rounded up) for the calculation.

At 20th level, you add your full Charisma modifier instead.

## Level 6: Maximized Output (Technique Improvement)
By spending the maximum amount of Cursed Energy you can into your technique, it becomes much stronger and harder to avoid. 

Whenever you spend the maximum amount of Cursed Energy, the technique gains a +1 bonus to its attack roll. If it's a saving throw, it instead increases its DC by +1.

At 11th level, the bonus increases to +2, becoming +3 at 17th level, and +4 at 20th level.

## Level 10: Ritual of Lights (Technique Improvement)
You have made a new discovery about your technique. By putting in additional effort, you can push your technique to its absolute peak. 

You gain proficiency in the Performance skill, or expertise if you are already proficient. If you already have expertise, you add your Charisma modifier once more to the roll.

As a full-turn action, you can spend 9 Cursed Energy to begin an elaborate dance that enhances someone's output beyond their limits. For each additional stage you wish to perform, you must spend an extra 5 Cursed Energy and use another full-turn action on that turn. The benefits and requirements for each stage become increasingly difficult to achieve.

***Ritual Maintenance.*** You must maintain concentration to keep your Ritual going. For a saving throw to be required, the attack must have successfully reduced your actual hit points, not temporary hit points. The DC for the saving throw is 10 or 1/4 of the damage taken, whichever is higher. If you fail the concentration saving throw, you can spend 2 Cursed Energy to succeed instead.

If you possess your level 20 feature Otherworldly Output, the DC for each stage is reduced by 5, except for your partner’s in the fourth stage.

## Level 14: Tokyo School Feature - Honored One (Extension Technique)
*`Prerequisite: Tokyo Jujutsu High school`*

While your technique was always focused on enhancing multiple allies at once, your studies at Tokyo have revealed that by restricting it to one person, you can elevate your technique to new heights. 

As a full-turn action for 20 Cursed Energy, you can choose one creature within 20 meters of you. This creature gains the same benefits they would receive from a Tier 3 Ritual of Lights for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 round).

You are concentrating for the duration of this feature. For a saving throw to be required, the attack must have successfully reduced your actual hit points, not temporary hit points. The DC for the saving throw is 10 or 1/4 of the damage taken, whichever is higher.

If you lose concentration, the creature loses the benefits. You can only have one creature receiving the benefits of this technique at a time.

## Level 20: Otherworldly Output (Technique Improvement)
You have reached the maximum potential of your technique, with the output increase evolving to the point of enlightening those affected. 

Whenever you use Solo Forbidden Area, you add your Charisma modifier twice instead of once.

## Technique Reversal: Area of Depletion
*`Prerequisite: Cursed Technique Reversal feat`*

Your mastery over Reverse Cursed Technique has unlocked your Cursed Technique reversal. This allows you to create an area that drains enemies of their Cursed Energy. 

As an action, by spending up to your Charisma modifier plus your proficiency bonus in Cursed Energy, you can create this technique in a 5-meter radius circle centered around yourself. 

Creatures of your choice within that circle at the beginning of your turn must make a Charisma saving throw or lose an amount of Cursed Energy equal to the amount you spent at the beginning of your turn. 

This effect lasts for 1 minute as long as they remain within the circle.
