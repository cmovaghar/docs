title: 'Domain Properties'
---

Internal volume, creation speed, barrier parameters—by finding the right blend of these and other properties, every sorcerer can create their own domain. However, these properties are not immutable, and those highly skilled with their domain can alter them on the fly. A creature with the Barrier Master sorcerer path is considered 100 refinement higher for the purposes of the following options.

## Barrier Resistance
*`650 Refinement`*

You have realized that the stronger the barrier on the inside of a domain, the weaker it is on the outside. Through skill, you have found ways to circumvent this. As part of expanding your domain, you may choose to make your barrier vulnerable on the inside in exchange for it becoming resistant to all damage on the outside. Additionally, you can spend an extra 5 cursed energy when expanding your domain to make it perfectly balanced, causing both the inside and outside to have no vulnerabilities or immunities. This feature cannot be used by a barrierless domain.

## Barrier Movement
*`750 Refinement`*

You’ve come to understand that your domain need not remain static once expanded. At the beginning of your turn while your domain expansion is active, you may choose to move the domain up to 120 feet in any direction. The relative positions of creatures inside the domain do not change due to this movement. This feature cannot be used by a barrierless domain.

## Barrier Entry 
*`800 Refinement`*

You have discovered the ability to selectively allow things into your domain while denying others. As a free action while your domain is active, you may alter the barrier to permit one thing to pass through unimpeded. For example, you could allow living creatures to enter and leave freely while keeping non-living things trapped. This feature cannot be used to stop creatures from leaving a barrierless domain.

## Barrier Enlargement 
*`850 Refinement`*

You have learned that stretching your barrier can massively increase its range, though at the cost of durability. As a bonus action while your domain is active, you can spend cursed energy up to a maximum of your Charisma modifier, increasing your domain's radius by 20 feet for each point spent. You can choose whether creatures that would be caught by the new radius are pushed to the new edge of the domain, as per normal domain expansion rules, or enter the domain. While enlarged, the maximum and current health of the barrier is reduced by three times the amount of feet the range is increased. This lasts until the end of the domain or until the range is altered again by another feature. This feature cannot be used by a barrierless domain.

## Barrier Compression 
*`950 Refinement`*

You’ve discovered a method to make your domain take up less space, reinforcing the barrier. As a bonus action while your domain is active, you can spend 5 cursed energy to compress it, shrinking the outside to a small 5-foot circle while maintaining the same internal size. While compressed, your barrier gains damage reduction equal to 30 times your Charisma modifier. If used on a barrierless domain, the damage your domain would deal (if any) is increased by half of that amount instead. This effect lasts until the end of the domain.
