title: 'Domain Amplification'
---

A unique and advanced technique that allows you to cover yourself in your domain without imbuing a technique into it. 

As an action, you can spend up to half of your level (rounded up) in cursed energy to "wear" your domain, neutralizing cursed techniques for 1 minute. Once activated, you automatically dampen any defensive technique, offensive technique, or spell that affects you, and you can bypass barriers such as Infinity and defensive innate techniques. 

While active, you gain damage reduction to Innate Techniques or Spells equal to the amount spent, multiplied by 10. Additionally, conditions and effects from Innate Techniques and Spells are negated against you, unless they possess an original cost (before reductions) higher than the amount spent on Amplification or are under Maximum Output. 

You can dismiss Domain Amplification as a bonus action. Even if dismissed, you can reactivate it as a bonus action without spending cursed energy again for the duration of the minute.

Domain Amplification works on contact with your body, so ranged attacks and features that do not make physical contact will not gain the benefits of Domain Amplification. You cannot use Domain Amplification while your Domain Expansion is active unless you have 950 refinement or higher and the Flawless Fundamentals feat, with all categories reduced.

You must have a complete domain to use Domain Amplification.

When you activate Amplification and while it is active, you cannot use your Innate Technique, and any active durations or effects will be stopped and interrupted. You may instead choose to maintain active durations and effects from your Innate Technique, attempting to ‘pause’ it while Amplification is active. At the beginning of your turns while Amplification is active, you must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a success, your technique is successfully ‘paused,’ rather than being interrupted. On a failure, the technique is ended and interrupted as normal.

### Learning Domain Amplification
Over the course of a long rest, a creature with knowledge of Domain Amplification and how it works may attempt to learn it by making a series of three DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) checks. If you succeed all three, you will learn Domain Amplification. If you fail any one of the checks, you must wait until the next long rest to attempt learning Amplification again.

***Amplification Innovation.*** If you do not possess knowledge of Domain Amplification and its inner workings, you may attempt to develop it for yourself by making the normal Intelligence (Arcana) checks, but you must roll them with disadvantage.

***Assisted Amplification.*** If you are learning from or being taught by a creature that possesses Domain Amplification, you may instead roll the Arcana checks using Charisma instead of Intelligence.

***Improvised Amplification.*** If you possess a great talent for learning and developing skills (such as showing impressive aptitude for learning or possessing the Jujutsu Genius feat), your DM may allow you to roll to learn Amplification over the course of a short rest or even a shorter period of time.

### Ways of Refinement

There are multiple ways to refine your domain, ranging from training alone to clashing with other people's domains. Below is a list of ways to gain refinement points:
|Method|Description|Refinement Points Gained|
|:-|:-|:-:|
|Training|Probably the slowest method, but every bit of progress counts. Once per day, you can spend 5 cursed energy to refine your domain. This cursed energy can only be regained the next day. However, this method has a limitation: you can only refine your domain alone to a certain extent. Upon reaching 500 refinement, you can no longer use this method to refine your domain.|1|
|Unstoppable Power|Countermeasures were created to protect against Domain Expansions, but even these are not completely reliable against the most powerful domains. Whenever your domain breaks through or overcomes a domain countermeasure, it gains refinement based on whether it was Hollow Wicker Basket, Falling Blossom Emotion, or Simple Domain.|1, 2 and 4 respectively|
|Domain Casualties|One of the quicker methods of refining your domain is by defeating opponents with your cursed techniques while inside it. If you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points while it’s inside your Domain Expansion, you will gain refinement points. The refinement points are only gained if the creature's Challenge Rating (CR) is at least half of your Jujutsu Sorcerer level (rounded up).|5 per creature|
|Domain Supremacy|The best way to refine your domain is by subjugating another with your own. If you win a domain clash, you'll gain refinement points from your domain's superiority. You can only benefit from this once per individual domain clash.|30|
