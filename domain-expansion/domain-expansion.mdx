Domain Expansion is the ultimate technique of any jujutsu sorcerer. It is achieved by expanding one's innate domain using cursed energy while constructing a barrier to contain it within a separate space. The caster then imbues their cursed technique into the domain, allowing their ability to manifest and take full effect throughout the enclosed area.
