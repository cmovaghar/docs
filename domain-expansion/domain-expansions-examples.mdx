Through many battles and copies, you have finally learned how to expand your domain. Inside this barrier, you are surrounded by a world of blades and broken pillars. 

You may apply a copied technique as the sure-hit effect, doubling its damage for this purpose, and force the other techniques you've copied into blades. 

At the start of each of your turns, you may pick up one of these blades as a free action and roll a d6 (with each value corresponding to a technique you choose when you open the domain) to determine the copied technique within the blade. You may then use that technique without expending cursed energy until the start of your next turn. However, its damage does not increase from using a domain when used in this way.

The sword disappears at the start of your next turn.

## Ceremonial Sea of Light

You have refined your innate technique to its peak, mastering your Domain Expansion. Your domain manifests as a vast forest, filled with dense flora and towering trees, with plants constantly growing and actively targeting creatures. Inside your domain, the terrain is difficult, and it is heavily obscured for all creatures except you.

At the beginning of their turns, all creatures must make a Strength saving throw due to the plants swarming around them. On a failure, they are restrained by roots. On a success, they avoid being restrained by the roots.

Once restrained, the plants begin releasing toxic clouds in the surrounding area, forcing the creature to make a Constitution saving throw at the start of their turns. On a failure, they take 20d8 poison damage and are poisoned. On a success, they take half the damage and are not poisoned.

After being poisoned by the plants, the toxin begins to warp the creature's senses, causing them to hallucinate. The creature continues hallucinating until they succeed on a Constitution saving throw.

## Chimera Shadow Garden

You have mastered the ability to expand your domain from the shadows. Your domain takes the form of a massive shadow barrier, enveloping your surroundings in overwhelming darkness. Any hostile creatures that end their turn within the range of your domain must make a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained. They can attempt to break free by making a Strength saving throw at the start of their turn, ending the effect on a success. The area is considered difficult terrain for all creatures of your choice, and you benefit from the effects of Freedom of Movement as long as you remain within the domain.

***Shadow Clones.*** As a bonus action while inside the domain, you can spend a number of cursed energy points equal to your Charisma modifier to create that many clones of yourself. The clones are identical to you, but they do not retain your weapons, hit points, or cursed energy. Their hit points are equal to your Charisma modifier, and they dissolve into shadow puddles when reduced to 0 hit points. You can use your reaction to swap places with a clone when you are about to be hit, making the clone take the hit instead.

***Shikigami Clones.*** Your domain also allows you to summon copies of your shikigami to overwhelm your opponents. When you summon a shikigami, you can spend additional cursed energy equal to the shikigami's cost (even if the shikigami normally costs 0 cursed energy, its cost is treated as if you were outside your domain) to summon a perfect copy of the shikigami. You can use this ability up to a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier on the same turn. You cannot create copies of Mahoraga with this feature.

Additionally, your shikigami no longer cost you cursed energy.

The Dexterity and Strength saving throws imposed by your domain, along with their effects, are the sure-hit effect of this domain.

## Coffin Of The Iron Mountain

You have learned to expand your domain, creating a vast magma dimension. Your domain is a massive, magma-filled space that radiates extreme heat. While inside it, every creature except you must attempt a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a failure, they take 30d12 fire damage and, if they failed by 5 or more, they gain one level of exhaustion. On a success, they take half the damage and do not gain a level of exhaustion. Creatures inside the domain have disadvantage on attack rolls unless they have immunity to fire damage.

The Constitution saving throw and its effects caused by this domain are the sure-hit effect of your domain.

## Deadly Artillery
*`Custom Domain Expansion Example`*

Inside your domain is a vast warzone filled with cannons loaded with giant missiles. At the beginning of each round, every creature of your choice within the domain must make a Dexterity saving throw as the cannons fire their missiles. On a failure, they take 20d12 force damage plus 30d4 fire damage and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half as much damage and are not knocked prone.

The Dexterity saving throw and its effects caused by your domain are the sure-hit effect of your domain.

## Heaven's Gate
*`Custom Domain Expansion Example`*

Your domain is a beautiful blue sky filled with clouds, with a shining sun illuminating everything. All hostile creatures inside must make a Wisdom saving throw at the beginning of their turns or be considered falling, even if they have flying speed. The creatures may repeat their saving throw at the beginning of their turns, ending the effect on a success. If a creature is falling within your domain, it takes twice as much damage from your cursed techniques. Once the domain ends, any creature that was considered "falling" takes the maximum amount of fall damage.

The Wisdom saving throw, its effects, and the falling damage caused by your domain are the sure-hit effect of your domain.

## Horizon of the Captivating Skandha
<img

  alt="Horizon of the Captivating Skandha"
/>

The inside of your domain features an island surrounded by a sea, with an artificial sun providing heat and light. While within your domain, you gain an additional Action that may only be used for your Death Swarm technique.

Any attacks made by your Death Swarm shikigami are affected by the sure-hit feature of your domain.

## Malevolent Shrine
<img

  alt="Malevolent Shrine"
/>

You have reached the peak of your innate technique, enabling you to finally use your Domain Expansion. A shrine composed of skeleton pieces manifests behind you, and a barrier forms around it. 

At the start of your turns, all creatures within the domain's range receive two cursed energy attack rolls, based on their cursed energy. Creatures with no cursed energy or spellcasting receive two attacks from Dismantle, while creatures with cursed energy or spellcasting receive two attacks from Cleave. The Dismantles count as if you have spent the maximum amount of cursed energy, while the Cleaves count as if you have spent a number of cursed energy equal to your Charisma modifier multiplied by three.

Objects and structures within the domain's radius also receive the attack rolls at the beginning of each round.

The Dismantles and Cleaves triggered by this domain are the sure-hit effect of your domain.

## Self-Embodiment of Perfection
<img

  alt="Self-Embodiment of Perfection"
/>

You have mastered your powers and unlocked your most powerful technique. You create a vast dimension filled with your body parts, making escaping death nearly impossible. At the beginning of each of your turns, all creatures except you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 30d12 necrotic damage. On a success, they take half as much damage. If this damage reduces a creature to less than a quarter of their maximum hit points, they are instantly transformed into Transfigured creatures.

While within your domain, your Idle Transfiguration feature can now be used as a cursed energy attack roll, and you may replace attacks from your attack action with it.

The ability to use Idle Transfiguration as a cursed energy attack roll, as well as the Constitution saving throw and its effects caused by this domain, are the sure-hit effects of this domain.

## Threefold Affliction
<img

  alt="Threefold Affliction"
/>

While inside your domain, you can create any of your items without spending cursed energy. All of these items deal one additional damage die and count as magical, also benefiting from the sure-hit effect. However, these weapons only last until the end of the domain.

## Time Cell Moon Palace
<img
  src="/images/domain-expansion/time-cell-moon-palace.png"
  alt="Time Cell Moon Palace"
/>

Expanding this domain creates a vast, black, empty area, save for a few floating particles and the main stage of the environment. The primary stage of the Time Cell Moon Palace is a straight path of flesh leading to a large eye positioned behind the caster. All creatures within your domain must make a Wisdom saving throw at the beginning of their turns. On a failure, they fall under the "24 FPS Rule" at the cellular levelâ€” their body cells become misaligned, rendering them unable to move, automatically skipping their turn, and suffering 20d10 necrotic damage.

The Wisdom saving throw and its effects caused by this domain are the sure-hit effect of your domain.

## Unlimited Void
<img
  src="/images/domain-expansion/unlimited-void.png"
  alt="Unlimited Void"
/>

You have mastered the ability to expand your domain, unleashing the Unlimited Void upon your opponents. 

You create a void in space that bombards victims with endless stimuli and information, restricting their thought processes and actions. Every creature caught in the Domain Expansion that is not touching you must attempt an Intelligence saving throw at the start of their turns. On a failure, they take 20d8 psychic damage, and their Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores become 1. They are unable to cast spells, attack, use magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way, and they fall unconscious for 1 minute. On a success, they take 10d8 psychic damage. At the end of each minute, the creature may repeat this saving throw, ending the effects on a success. This condition can also be ended by Greater Restoration or Wish.

If this domain is used with the 0.2 Second Domain Expansion, the creatures can remake their saving throw at the beginning of each of their turns to end the condition early, and it no longer deals damage.

The Intelligence saving throw and its effect caused by this domain are the sure-hit effect of your domain.

## Womb Profusion
<img

  alt="Womb Profusion"
/>

A tree of souls surrounded by four seated Buddhas at the cardinal points emerges behind you as your barrier begins to open. The area targeted by this feature counts as difficult terrain for all creatures. At the start of each chosen creature's turn, they must make a Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to your Maximum Uzumaki's damage and become prone. The Uzumaki is treated as if you have spent the maximum number of spirits you can.

The Dexterity saving throw and its effects caused by this domain are the sure-hit effect of this domain.
