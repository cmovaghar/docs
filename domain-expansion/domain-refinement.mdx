title: 'Domain Refinement'
---

As with every technique, Domain Expansion improves with refinement and specialization. A refined domain and a normal domain are very different. In the case of a normal domain, most semi-grade 1 or higher sorcerers could escape, but a refined domain can pose a significant challenge even for special grade sorcerers.

### Refinement Points
The longer you refine your domain, the more its refinement points will increase. You start with 1 refinement point, which influences various aspects of your domain. Your refinement limit is 1000 points, a milestone only the elite of the elite have ever reached.

### Refinement Benefits

The more you refine your domain, the more versatile it becomes. Depending on your refinement points, you will gain the following benefits:

***Domain Durability (1+ Refinement Points)***. Your domain's durability increases with refinement. For every refinement point you have, your domain hit points increase by +1.

***Technique Efficiency (100 Refinement Points).*** With your cursed technique already infused into your barrier, using it becomes almost effortless. You may choose to reduce the cost of your lapse technique to 0 while casting it inside your domain.

***Quicker Expansion (200 Refinement Points).*** Through extensive training, you have learned to use your domain hand signs more efficiently. Your domain now costs an action instead of a full-turn action.

***Increased Potency (300 Refinement Points).*** While inside your domain, your techniques are at their strongest. Your cursed techniques and any domain damage gain additional dice equal to your Charisma modifier, a +5 bonus to their DCs, and a +5 bonus to hit.

***Enhanced Technique Efficiency (400 Refinement Points).*** With your domain's enhanced potency, the imbued technique's power is further amplified. While within your domain, the cursed energy cost of your Extension techniques is reduced by half of your proficiency bonus (rounded up), to a minimum of 1.

***Lasting Domain (500 Refinement Points).*** Through great practice, you have learned to extend the duration of your domain. Your domain now lasts for 2 minutes instead of 1.

***0.2 Domain Expansion (600 Refinement Points).*** You have learned to expand your domain so quickly that almost no one can react to it. When opening your domain in this way, it lasts only until the end of your turn. The cost for this domain expansion is halved, and creatures caught inside it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, reacting to this domain takes double the usual amount of reactions, while on a success, they can react as normal. This saving throw is made at disadvantage unless the creature has a higher Dexterity score than your Charisma score. When opening your domain this way, all creatures inside are affected by its effects, and you cannot choose who is targeted. Any of your Domain Expansion's effects that would normally occur at the start of a creature's turn, whether it's yours or another creature's, happen immediately when you expand your domain in this manner.

***Efficient Expansions (700 Refinement Points).*** Opening and maintaining a domain is no easy task, requiring vast amounts of cursed energy, practice, and refinement. Through your training, you have reduced the cost of your domain expansion by your Charisma modifier. Additionally, you only gain 1 level of exhaustion after your domain ends, and the DC to use your technique while in Burnout is reduced to 25. If you are a Cursed Spirit, the DC is further reduced to 15.

***Durable Barrier (800 Refinement Points).*** Your domain barrier has become incredibly durable, making escape or forced entry nearly impossible. Your domain gains immunity to non-magical damage from both sides; however, it remains resistant to all damage from the inside and vulnerable to all damage from the outside. Additionally, your domain's refinement points are doubled when calculating its hit points.

***Domain Superiority (900 Refinement Points).*** Your domain is nearing the absolute peak of refinement, a realm where even the slightest imperfection can lead to disaster. The refinement thresholds that determine how long it takes to destroy another domain in a clash are halved.

***Mastered Domain (1000 Refinement Points).*** You have reached the pinnacle of Jujutsu, mastering Domain Expansion. Your mastery of domain hand signs allows you to expand your domain as a bonus action instead of an action. You can reduce your domain expansion's cost by your proficiency bonus, and while inside the domain, techniques that normally use an action can now be used as a bonus action, and techniques that take a bonus action can now be used as a free action. Additionally, your domain now lasts for 3 minutes.

### Refinement Mastery

If you have the Reverse Cursed Technique Mastery Boon, you gain the following feature:

***Burnout Recovery.*** You have discovered a simple solution to the complicated issue of Technique Burnout: simply substitute your brain for a new one! While under the effects of Technique Burnout, you can expend 8 cursed energy and 800 points from your RCT healing pool as a reaction to regain your Cursed Technique and remove the exhaustion caused by burnout. Each time you use this feature, you must succeed on a DC 5 Constitution saving throw. On a success, you regain your Cursed Technique without major consequences. On a failure, your eyes and nose begin to bleed profusely, and you take 8d6 psychic damage. You also cannot take actions or bonus actions until the start of your next turn.

The Constitution saving throw DC increases by 5 for each success, is reduced by 5 for every minute that passes, and returns to its original DC at the end of a long rest.
