title: 'Domain Battle'

When two domains expand at the same time, a domain clash occurs, a battle determined by which sorcerer has the more refined domain and greater talent.

### Domain Clash
Once a creature expands their domain, you may use your reaction to expand your own domain in response. The outcome of the domain battle is determined by the sorcerer with the most refinement points, which will be the deciding factor. However, even if your refinement points exceed those of your opponent, it will take a number of rounds equal to the difference in refinement points to destroy the opposing domain. See the table below for the number of rounds required:

|Refinement Points Above|Rounds Needed To Overlap|
|:-:|:-:|
|20|9|
|40|8|
|60|7|
|80|6|
|100|5|
|120|4|
|140|3|
|160|2|
|180|1|
|200|0|

During a domain clash, the sure-hit effect and sure-hit feature of both domains are negated. The domain expansions will create an area equal to the combined size of both barriers. Once you break the domain, your sure-hit effect will resume.

Additionally, even a brief moment of distraction before a domain battle can lead to disaster. When a hostile creature expands their domain and you respond by expanding yours, if you have already taken a reaction during that round of combat, you must make a contested check against the creature. This check is based on your Cursed Energy Modifier or a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, as determined by the DM. If you succeed in the contest, the clash proceeds as normal. 

However, if you lose the contest, the creature and any other creatures within your domain are subjected to the sure-hit effect as if the creature’s domain were in its 0.2 Domain Expansion variation. After that, the domain clash proceeds as usual, with the sure-hit effects cancelling each other out. 

This interaction usually only occurs if the reactions taken during the round were particularly difficult or strenuous, such as Burnout Recovery. It typically doesn’t occur if the reactions were simpler, like those granted by a feature for specific uses (e.g., making an opportunity attack).

### Equal Refinement Domain Clashes
Although an extremely unlikely scenario in most cases, when two sorcerers of equal refinement clash, it creates a god-like spectacle visible to outside observers. 

When two Domain Expansions with equal refinement clash, they completely nullify each other, neither overpowering nor being overpowered. It then becomes up to the two sorcerers to maintain their domain while attempting to break the opponent's. 

As soon as one of the domain casters reaches 1/3 (rounded down) of their maximum hit points, they must succeed in a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on their domain, as if they were concentrating on a spell. 

On a success, the domain remains stable, and they can continue. 

On a failure, their domain breaks, yielding to the opponent's, and they suffer the aftereffects of Burnout from Domain Expansion.
