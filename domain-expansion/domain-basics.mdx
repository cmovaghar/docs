Each Domain Expansion is unique, varying in hand signs and techniques. However, all domains follow the same fundamental rules unless otherwise stated.

### Completing Your Domain
During a long rest, a creature with sufficient knowledge of Domain Expansion may attempt to learn it by making a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, and a DC 25 Charisma saving throw. If all three rolls succeed, you learn Domain Expansion. If you fail any one of them, you must wait until your next long rest to attempt learning it again.

***Assisted Development.*** If you are learning from a knowledgeable creature that possesses Domain Expansion, you may substitute Charisma for Intelligence when rolling the Arcana check and roll one of the saving throws with advantage.

***Rapid Development.*** If you display exceptional talent for learning jujutsu (such as through extraordinary aptitude or possessing the Jujutsu Genius feat), your DM may allow you to attempt learning Domain Expansion over a short rest or even a shorter period.

### Expanding Your Domain
Activating Domain Expansion requires a specific hand sign and takes a Full Turn Action to cast. It costs 30 Cursed Energy unless otherwise specified and traps all chosen creatures within range inside your domain for 1 minute.

A domain's interior is unique to each user, reflecting their soul. From the outside, all domains appear as giant black spheres floating in the air. The properties of a domain—such as range, damage, and effects—vary based on its creator and should be clearly defined upon creation.

<Note>
	While domain sizes may vary, the radius should be at least 3 meters, with a recommended range of 15 to 20 meters at most. Work with your DM to determine an appropriate size.
</Note>

Creatures outside the domain are forcibly pushed to the edge of the barrier, taking 1d4 bludgeoning damage per object they collide with. If they are pinned against a wall, they must hold their breath until the domain closes or shrinks.

The barrier is impenetrable—no form of movement (walking, burrowing, flying, teleportation, etc.) can pass through it. You may deactivate your Domain Expansion at will (no action required).

### Technique Burnout
Even if the barrier or environment is not fully formed, casting a Domain Expansion will cause the user's innate technique to become unstable for a short time afterward. Immediately after ending your Domain Expansion, you gain 2 levels of exhaustion for 1 minute.

During this time, your innate technique becomes difficult to use. To activate any of your techniques, you must pay Cursed Energy equal to the feature's cost (before reductions) in addition to its regular cost, and you must make a DC 30 Constitution saving throw. 

On a failure, your technique fails, and you lose the Cursed Energy spent trying to use it.

On a success, the technique activates, but any damage it deals, its range, area of effect, and duration are all halved. 

Domain Expansion cannot be forced in this way.

If you are a Cursed Spirit, the DC is 20 instead of 30.

### Sure Hit
Domains that are expanded to be lethal are constructed within a barrier imbued with the user's cursed technique. The caster's abilities are amplified, and any cursed techniques used within the domain are guaranteed to hit their target. 

This sure-hit effect comes from the barrier's embedded technique, which is what makes this type of domain considered lethal. While inside the domain's radius, all of your cursed techniques are affected by the sure-hit effect. 

No matter the result of your cursed energy attack roll, it will be considered a hit. Creatures automatically fail saving throws against your cursed technique for the purpose of dealing damage (though not for conditions or additional effects). 

At 600 refinement or higher, you may choose which targets inside the domain are affected by this sure-hit effect. Additionally, the range of any cursed technique is expanded to cover the entire domain, even if it is normally limited to touch range. 

Finally, any feature that negates, reduces, or avoids attacks, saving throws, damage, or conditions does not work against a feature affected by this, unless it specifically states otherwise. 

Domains also have a passive effect called the sure-hit effect. If this effect inflicts damage or conditions, the domain is considered Lethal; if it does not, it is considered Non-Lethal.
