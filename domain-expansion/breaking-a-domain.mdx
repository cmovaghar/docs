title: 'Breaking a Domain'
---

Although Domain Expansion is an exceptionally powerful and refined technique that only the highest-level sorcerers can possess, it can still be broken with enough force.

<Note>
	Opening a hole inside a domain doesnâ€™t go unnoticed. You automatically know when a hole has been created in your domain.

## Barrier Hit Points
Your domain barrier is incredibly durable, capable of resisting even the most destructive attacks. However, cursed imbued attacks can pierce through the barrier, though they are not very effective unless coming from outside. The domain barrier has hit points equal to 100 times your Charisma modifier plus your refinement points. The barrier's AC equals your cursed energy DC. Your domain barrier is immune to psychic damage.

## Clashes With Three or More Domains
Typically, when clashing with another creature, the external barriers remain stable. However, when three or more creatures engage in a domain clash, the external barriers become unstable and more fragile. If a creature enters the area of a domain clash involving three or more domains, or attacks the barrier of such a clash, the barrier and all domains involved immediately shatter, ending the clash. All creatures in the clash experience burnout as their domains end simultaneously.

## Weak Spot
All barrier techniques have a weak spot, and Domain Expansions are no different. You can only deal damage to a domain's hit points after discovering its weak spot, unless you are outside the domain.

## From Inside
Breaking a barrier from the inside is nearly impossible. Even if you locate the weak point of the barrier, you'll still be affected by the domain's constant effects. To break a domain from the inside, you must first find its weak spot by making a DC 30 Perception check. On a failure, you cannot locate the weak spot. On a success, you will find it, allowing you to target it with your attacks. The weak spot's AC equals the domain caster's cursed energy DC.

## From Outside
While breaking a barrier from the inside is nearly impossible, doing so from the outside is much easier. You may target the domain with your attacks. The domain automatically fails all saving throws and is vulnerable to all damage types except psychic damage.

## Forming a Weak Spot
Sometimes, despite seeming disadvantageous, you can force your way into a domain expansion by creating a weak spot, typically a hole. After reducing the domain's hit points to one-third or less, you can take an action to make a Strength or Charisma saving throw to forcibly open the domain. On a failure, no hole is created. On a success, you form a 10ft. by 10ft. hole that allows you and any creatures to enter the domain. Any creature that enters the domain will suffer the effects of the sure-hit. You may also use this feature from within a domain to form a hole leading outside, though the DC is affected by the increased Cursed Energy DC provided by the Domain Expansion.

## Forming a Weak Spot Using a Domain
Forming a weak spot is a challenging task, but it becomes easier when using a Domain for the task. As part of expanding your Domain, you can concentrate to create a hole in an opponent's domain. When doing so, make a Charisma saving throw against the opponent's Cursed Energy DC. On a success, you form a 5ft. square hole that allows creatures on either side to pass through, which lasts as long as you maintain concentration. On a failure, no hole is formed, but you can take an action to attempt the saving throw again. For every 100 Refinement that the target domain has over your own, the DC to create a hole increases by +2.

Performing this task is more difficult while inside a Domain. When attempting to open a hole with your Domain from within an enemy's Domain, you must remain still. If you take damage, you must make Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. The sure-hit effect and features of both domains are negated during this process.
