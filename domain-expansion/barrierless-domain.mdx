title: 'Barrierless Domain'
---

When you expand your domain, you may choose not to create a barrier. Your maximum domain expansion range increases to 200 meters, with the center at the midpoint. However, you may opt to expand your domain with a smaller range if you wish.

As a Bonus Action, you can adjust the range of your domain (up to the 200 meters maximum). Your domain cannot be destroyed unless you take damage equal to 1/3 of your maximum hit points. At that point, you must make a DC 15 + half the damage taken Constitution saving throw. 

On a failure, the domain is destroyed. Your techniques still retain the sure-hit effect, but without a barrier, your domain is much easier to escape. 

Additionally, during a domain clash, your sure-hit effect is not negated outside the other domainâ€™s barrier if they have one. Furthermore, your sure-hit effect and cursed techniques can directly target the outside barrier of the opposing domain.
