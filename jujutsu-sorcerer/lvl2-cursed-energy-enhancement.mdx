You begin to focus your cursed energy to better manipulate it and have the option to learn one of the following techniques:

#### Cursed Strike
Before you make an unarmed strike, you may spend up to your proficiency bonus in cursed energy to empower your next strike. This enhancement lasts until you hit a creature with your unarmed strike or until a minute passes. 

On a hit, you deal additional necrotic damage equal to 1d8 per point spent. Depending on your Innate Technique, your additional damage changes to a specific damage type. You can also use this in response to rolling a natural 20 on an attack roll with an unarmed strike, or landing a black flash, instead of beforehand. 

You can only use this enhancement again after it has ended.

#### Cursed Armor
On your or another creature's turn, and for an amount of cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier (no action required), you can surround yourself with cursed energy for one minute. 

You gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of cursed energy spent times 5 for the duration. You can only benefit from this feature again after 1 minute or having your temporary hit points reduced to 0. 

Depending on your Innate Technique, you also gain resistance against a specific damage type while these temporary hit points last. If you cannot take actions, you cannot use this enhancement. 

The temporary hit points value increases to 10 instead of 5 at 11th level.

#### Cursed Weapon Enhancement
As a bonus action, you can spend cursed energy up to your proficiency bonus to enhance a melee weapon you are wielding for 1 minute. 

Whenever you hit a target with the weapon, it takes extra necrotic damage equal to twice the amount spent. Depending on your Innate Technique, your damage bonus changes to a specific damage type. You can only use this enhancement again after 1 minute has passed.

If you use this enhancement 25 times or more to the same weapon, it becomes a Semi-Cursed Tool as long as it's not already a cursed tool.
