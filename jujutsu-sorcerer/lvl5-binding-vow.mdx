<Note>
	Because binding vows offer a lot of creative freedom, many custom vows could become inherently unbalanced without the DMâ€™s oversight. To address this, we've created a list of [Binding Vow rules]() to help the DM know what to watch for, and to guide players in building their vows more fairly.
</Note>

You can create a binding vow with a willing creature or yourself, entering into a strict contract formed by Jujutsu. 

At any point, you can create one binding vow and choose one of the vows listed in the [Binding Vows](). 

During a combat encounter, once per round, you can make a Binding Vow (no action required).

You can have a maximum number of binding vows equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier, with a minimum of 2 at a time. 

During a Short or Long rest, you can end a number of Binding Vows equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).
