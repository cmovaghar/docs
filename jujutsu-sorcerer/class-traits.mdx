Jujutsu Sorcerers are individuals secretly trained and employed by the government of Japan to protect humanity from cursed spirits. 

Humans capable of using jujutsu are commonly referred to as Sorcerers, with the jujutsu prefix often signifying their affiliation with Jujutsu High. Evil jujutsu sorcerers are known as Curse Users, while humans who cannot use jujutsu are called Non-Sorcerers.
