As a Reincarnated, you were once a powerful individual from a millennia ago, whose life was interrupted by death. 

Through forbidden means, you were able to preserve your essence by becoming a cursed object or by relying on the intervention of others, allowing you to live through the ages. 

Now, reborn in the modern world, you have a new chance at life, with fresh objectives and goals that tie into the legacy you left behind. 

The world has changed since you first lived, and as you navigate the complexities of your reincarnation, you must uncover the purpose for your return, confront lingering ties from the past, and decide where your true loyalties lie in this new age.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** You are proficient in History and one more skill of your choice. 
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One artisan's tool of your choice or Talismans.
- **Equipment:** One simple or martial weapon of your choice. 

## Feature: Golden Age of Jujutsu
Before being resurrected, you lived during the Heian Era, the golden age of jujutsu. This grants you an immense knowledge of jujutsu and its arts. 

It is much easier for you to gain insight into jujutsu sorcery and discover information about other sorcerers. 

You take only a quarter of the time it would normally take a sorcerer to learn jujutsu-related subjects, such as cursed energy and seals.

## Alternate Feature: New Objective
You have returned to this world with a singular purpose, one you will pursue no matter the cost. 

Discuss this objective with your DM and how it will shape your character's story. 

Your DM can, and should, use your objective as a plot hook.
