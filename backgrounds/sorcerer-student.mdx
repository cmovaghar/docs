As a Sorcerer Student, you are in the early stages of your journey as a jujutsu sorcerer, honing your skills at one of the prestigious jujutsu educational institutions in either Tokyo or Kyoto. 

Trained under the watchful eyes of experienced mentors, you are learning to control your cursed energy and master the techniques necessary to exorcise cursed spirits. Your days are filled with intense study, rigorous physical training, and practical fieldwork, all designed to prepare you for the challenges that lie ahead in the dangerous world of jujutsu sorcery. 

Although you are still a student, your potential is vast, and the choices you make during your training will shape you into a powerful sorcerer—or perhaps something more.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose 2 from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Perception, Religion, Intimidation and Stealth
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Choose one type of artisan’s tools or Talismans.
- **Equipment:** 5 GP, a Jujutsu high uniform (commoner's clothes). 

## Feature: Student Support
As a student at Jujutsu High, you receive support from your teachers and the higher-ups. 

The school is more inclined to assist you than others, providing you with basic resources such as grade 4 cursed tools, a teacher to supervise your progress, and sending you on missions. 

Depending on your teacher, you may receive additional information or be assigned more challenging missions.

## Alternate Feature: Professional Sorcerer
After graduation, you chose to continue your path as a professional sorcerer. 

At the end of each month, you earn gold (GP) based on your grade and the number of missions you've completed, as determined by the DM.
