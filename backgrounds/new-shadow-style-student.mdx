As a New Shadow Style Student, you are trained in a unique and ancient fighting technique that blends swordsmanship with anti-domain techniques, originating from the Heian Era. 

Created by Sadatsuna Ashiya, the New Shadow Style was designed as a way for weaker sorcerers to stand against stronger foes. Its most famous technique, Simple Domain, is often referred to as the "domain for the weak," serving as a countermeasure against powerful domains. 

Unlike other sorcery techniques, the New Shadow Style has never been formally documented to prevent outsiders from learning it, resulting in the loss of many techniques over time and the development of new ones by those who have passed it down. 

As a student of this style, you are part of a long tradition, carrying the knowledge and discipline of this secretive school, and you possess the potential to become a skilled and versatile sorcerer with a unique fighting style.
