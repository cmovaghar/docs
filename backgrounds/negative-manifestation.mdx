As a Negative Manifestation, you are the result of negative emotions and cursed energy accumulating over time, creating a cursed spirit. 

Born from the lingering negative emotions of humans, you formed when cursed energy leaked from a human and gathered in one place, eventually taking physical form. 

This process often leads to a creature of pure cursed energy, capable of manifesting in a wide variety of shapes and abilities, depending on the nature of the emotions that birthed you. 

As a Negative Manifestation, you are a being born from malice, fear, sorrow, or anger, and your existence is tied to the curses and the darkness left behind by humanity's negative emotions. 

You may seek to understand your origins, interact with the world of humans, or even find a way to transcend your cursed existence. However, your nature as a cursed spirit means you are often at odds with jujutsu sorcerers, whose task is to eliminate beings like you.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Athletics, Acrobatics, Insight, Perception, Stealth, and Survival. 

## Feature: Form of Manifestation
Negative Manifestations are born in many ways. Roll a d4 to determine your form of manifestation or pick a form depending on your Cursed Spirit subrace.

|d4 | Form of Manifestation|

|2 | Disease Cursed Spirit|
|3 | Vengeful Cursed Spirit|
|4 | Cursed Womb|

### Imaginary Vengeful Cursed Spirit Feature: Goal of Self
You were manifested by the accumulated fear of the masses, and that fear defines your existence. You have a goal tied to the fear that created you. For example, a curse born from the fear of nature may strive to preserve it.

### Variant Imaginary Vengeful Cursed Spirit Feature: Natural Spirit
You were born from negative emotions directed toward a sacred concept, such as nature. 

As a result, you are different from most spirits, able to be Neutral or even Good in your own way. This also makes your cursed energy unique and harder to detect. When your cursed energy is tracked, you count as having expertise in Stealth and gain advantage on all related rolls. Additionally, if you hide within your concept, such as the woods, your cursed energy becomes completely untrackable.

### Disease Cursed Spirit Feature: Plague Knowledge
You were born from the fear caused by a disease, granting you great knowledge of how diseases work. You have an easier time discovering and learning information about diseases.

### Vengeful Cursed Spirit Feature: Back From the Darkness
Instead of being born from the negative emotions of others, you were created by your own desire for revenge. This drive fuels you, and you will follow any method necessary to achieve it.

### Cursed Womb Feature: Inoffensive Appearance
You were manifested, but not fully formed. Those around you may speculate and doubt your strength because of this, but those knowledgeable about the jujutsu world will recognize that you have the potential to give birth to a stronger cursed spirit.
