As a Curse User, you have chosen to wield jujutsu for malicious purposes, turning the very art meant to protect humanity into a tool of destruction.

Often motivated by personal ideals, vengeance, or greed, Curse Users use their cursed energy to inflict harm, manipulate others, or even kill. 

In contrast to traditional jujutsu sorcerers who protect humanity from cursed spirits, Curse Users align themselves with darker goals, sometimes even with cursed spirits or other like-minded individuals. 

Your path has led you to embrace the dark side of jujutsu sorcery, using forbidden techniques and powerful cursed abilities to further your ambitions. 

Historically, Curse Users have been prominent threats, particularly during the Heian Era, when their power was as feared as that of the most powerful cursed spirits. 

Whether driven by a thirst for power or a desire to reshape the world according to your vision, you stand in opposition to the forces of light, seeking to unravel the established order of jujutsu.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, Survival, Sleight of Hand, Intimidation, and Stealth

- **Tool Proficiencies:** Choose one type of artisan’s tools.

- **Equipment:** 10 GP, and a set of clothing (commoner's clothes).

## Feature: Cursed Underworld
Your life as a Curse User has deeply intertwined you with the darker side of jujutsu society. 

You maintain frequent contact with individuals who operate within the criminal underworld, whether they are low-level thugs or corrupt members of the Jujutsu Society. 

These people serve as a valuable network of contacts, each capable of providing information about the most illicit corners of the jujutsu world, including hidden locations, forbidden techniques, and influential figures in both the underworld and the Jujutsu Society itself.

Wherever you travel, whether it's the bustling streets of a city or the forgotten alleys, you can rely on these contacts to keep you informed and ahead of those who would oppose you.

## Alternate Feature: Turning a New Leaf
After years of living as a Curse User, you've made the difficult decision to abandon this dark path. Whether motivated by love, personal agency, or an unforeseen event that changed your outlook, you've decided to leave behind the malice, manipulation, and chaos of the cursed world. However, your past will not let you go so easily. 

As a former Curse User, you are now a target for those who wish to silence you and prevent any secrets you've learned from reaching the light. 

You know far too much about the inner workings of the criminal underworld, and powerful figures—both within and outside of the Jujutsu Society—may come looking for you, either to protect their interests or to ensure that your knowledge stays buried. 

Your decision to change your ways may come at a great personal cost, but it also grants you a chance at redemption—if you can survive the storm you’ve left behind.
