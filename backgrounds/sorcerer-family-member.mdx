As a member of a Sorcerer Family, you are born into a lineage of powerful jujutsu sorcerers, inheriting techniques passed down through generations.

Your family is one of the most prestigious in the jujutsu world, tied to one of the Big Three Sorcerer Families—the Zenin, Gojo, or Kamo families—each renowned for their unique and potent abilities. 

Growing up in such a family, you have been trained from a young age in the art of jujutsu, prepared to uphold the honor of your bloodline. 

The expectations are high, and your journey is filled with both privilege and pressure as you work to master your inherited techniques and carry on the legacy of your family.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two between Athletics, Acrobatics, Deception, Performance, Persuasion, and Religion.
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One artisan's tools of your choice.
- **Equipment:** 10 GP, a simple weapon, a clan's uniform.

### Inumaki Clan Feature: Jujutsu Outlaw
You were born into a family considered outlaws by the jujutsu world, and you are aware that they seek to eradicate sorcerers from their bloodline. 

If you have any levels in the jujutsu sorcerer class, your clan will treat you poorly and offer little to no support.

### Kamo Clan Feature: Pure Bloodline
You were born into a family that values blood purity, which has taught you to avoid the external jujutsu world while also giving you a deeper understanding of it. 

You find it easier to search for or remember information about the history of the jujutsu world. Due to your knowledge and wisdom, the higher-ups will be more willing to assist you.

### Gojo Clan Feature: The Strongest Clan
Born into a family of the strongest sorcerers, your voice carries maximum authority. 

Fellow sorcerers are more likely to listen to your ideas and will rarely oppose your actions. Your mere presence can diffuse conflicts, as it has the power to settle disputes. 

However, despite their willingness to hear you out, the higher-ups will dislike you.

### Zenin Clan Feature: Power Above All Else

You were born into a family where power is the only measure of your worth. Weakness is seen as shameful and ridiculed. 

You learn new combat skills—whether spells, fighting styles, or cursed techniques—twice as fast as others (for example, learning martial arts would take a normal person two weeks, but you would need only one). 

Your treatment by fellow Zenin clan members will depend on your power status.

Additionally, your clan possesses a significant portion of the Special Grade Cursed Tools, including the Split Soul Katana and the Inverted Spear of Heaven. Depending on your status and the urgency of the situation, you may either acquire or steal these tools. These cursed tools are unknown to the rest of the world, with only blood members aware of their locations.

## Alternate Feature: Exile
You have been exiled from your clan, either for committing a terrible crime, breaking a rule, or simply choosing to leave and never return. Whatever your reasons, one thing is certain: you want nothing to do with your clan anymore. 

Since leaving, your neutrality has made the other clans more accepting of you. You now find it easier to obtain information, ask for help, and trade with clans outside your own.
