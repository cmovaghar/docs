These types of cursed spirits possess cursed techniques that allow them to infect humans with their respective diseases, cursing and ultimately killing them.

As a Disease Cursed Spirit, you have the following traits.

***Born From the Plague.*** You are immune to disease, the poisoned condition, and poison damage.

***Disease Imbued Strikes.*** Your body is a living disease, and you can spread it with just a mere touch. Your natural weapons and unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d4 poison damage, which evolves to 1d6 at 5th level. Additionally, if you attempt to inflict the poisoned condition on a creature, they must make their saving throw with disadvantage.

***Walking Plague.*** People fear you simply from your presence, knowing that one touch could be lethal. Starting at 5th level, whenever you touch a creature with any part of your body, they must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failure, they become infected with the disease most suited to your Cursed Spirit. On a success, they become immune to this effect for 24 hours. This effect can occur only once per round. You should consult your GM to determine which disease best fits your Cursed Spirit.
