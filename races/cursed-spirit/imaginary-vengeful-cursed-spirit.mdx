When many people share a common fear, such as the image of famous yokai or ghost stories like the Nine-Tailed Fox, an Imaginary Vengeful Spirit can form. These spirits are widely feared by sorcerers and are classified separately to distinguish them from other types of curses.

As an Imaginary Vengeful Cursed Spirit, you have the following traits.

***Famous Name.*** You are based on a real-world fear, making people's fear of you far greater than that of other curses. Whenever you roll initiative, you can force every hostile creature that can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failure, they become frightened for one minute. They can reroll this saving throw at the beginning of their turns to end the condition early. On a success, they become immune to this feature for 24 hours. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) per long rest.

***Your Fears Become Real.*** Your source of fear has spread worldwide, granting you deep knowledge about it. Whenever you roll a skill check related to your source of fear, you do so with advantage.

***Sadism.*** You have an immense sadistic pleasure in tormenting your victims. Whenever you deal damage to a creature that is frightened of you, half of the total damage is converted into temporary hit points for yourself. These temporary hit points cannot exceed your level.
