Those whose deaths are tainted by curses may have their spirits corrupted and transformed into vengeful spirits.

As a Vengeful Cursed Spirit, you have the following traits.

***Grudge.*** You harbor a deep grudge against something or someone. Choose a creature type, size, and alignment. Whenever you deal damage or make an attack against creatures that match the chosen conditions, you may add a +1 bonus to the attack roll or damage.

***Not Going Down.*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you may choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. You can use this feature once per long rest.

***Revenge.*** You have a strong sense of vengeance and cannot stand being wronged. When a creature hits you, you can choose to make your next attack against them with advantage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
