These spirits haunt and harm humanity, making them the primary targets of jujutsu sorcerers and exorcists.

Cursed spirits are entirely composed of cursed energy. Their metaphysical nature makes it impossible for non-sorcerers to perceive or interact with them. Living humans who have been cursed may experience strange symptoms without realizing that a cursed spirit is behind it. However, non-sorcerers whose lives are directly threatened by a curse may gain the ability to see it in those life-or-death moments.

Curses come in a wide variety of grotesque shapes and sizes. Special-grade cursed spirits with high intelligence are often bipedal and take forms similar to humans. These spirits are capable of holding normal conversations and can work together in an organized group.

As a Cursed Spirit, you have the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 3, while your Intelligence score decreases by 3. Your scores cannot exceed 20 or drop below 7 as a result of this change. Additionally, your Intelligence maximum is reduced by 3.

***Age.*** From the day of your creation, you are cursed to live until you are exorcised.

***Alignment.*** Cursed Spirits rarely retain intelligence, but when they do, their alignment tends to be more Chaotic or Evil.

***Size.*** Cursed Spirits vary greatly in size, with some being gigantic and others minuscule. You may choose your size, ranging from Small to Large.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 10 meters.

***Abnormal Body.*** As a cursed spirit, your body appears bizarre and grotesque due to your unnatural formations. You gain 3 features from the [Body Modifications List](body-modifications-list).

***Cursed Nature.*** As a Cursed Spirit, your body is formed from humanity's impure thoughts, making you vulnerable to radiant damage. Being composed of cursed energy, anything you consume is converted into cursed energy. You may use an action to devour a corpse within your reach to regain cursed energy equal to the corpseâ€™s Jujutsu Sorcerer level (minimum of 1), up to your maximum. This does not work if that creature had a *Heavenly Restriction*. Additionally, you do not require a medium, such as a talisman, to summon Shikigami.

***Evolving Monster.*** As a cursed spirit, you continuously evolve, growing stronger and smarter. You can refer to the [Cursed Spirit Grades](cursed-spirit-grades) to determine your current grade as a cursed spirit, which grants you various benefits. Each time your grade increases, you retain the benefits of your previous grade unless it specifically states that you do not.

***Hard to Kill.*** If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead and are considered stable. This feature does not work if the damage that reduced you to 0 hit points was radiant damage. You may use this feature once per long rest. Additionally, you have resistance to psychic damage, as your body and mind are vastly different from those of humans, sorcerers, or non-sorcerers alike.

***Invisible Force.*** You are entirely made of cursed energy, meaning you are invisible to normal people. Creatures without levels in the Jujutsu Sorcerer class or the ability to perceive the ethereal plane cannot see you. However, if these creatures are in a life-and-death situation (with less than 1/4 of their maximum hit points remaining), they gain the ability to see you.

***Undead Nature.*** You no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe, and you do not require sleep. You have advantage on saving throws against disease and poison, and you have resistance to poison damage.

***Cursed Spirit Type.*** You embody a specific Cursed Spirit type. Choose between *Vengeful Cursed Spirit*, *Imaginary Vengeful Cursed Spirit*, and *Disease Cursed Spirit*.
