When you were incarnated into your current vessel, your form emerged distorted, making you resemble a cursed spirit far more than a human.

You gain the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 1.

***Spirit Body.*** Your body is grotesque and unnatural, much like a cursed spiritâ€™s. You gain two points to spend in the Cursed Spirit's [Body Modifications List](/races/cursed-spirit/body-modifications-list).

***Curse Potential.*** You can select feats exclusive to cursed spirits and are considered to have no subrace for feat requirements. (You cannot gain Special Grade Curse, Regeneration, or Advanced Regeneration through this feature.)

***Intimidating Appearance.*** Your cursed form is unnerving. You gain proficiency in Intimidation. Additionally, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks against humanoid creatures that are not Jujutsu Sorcerers, Heavenly Restriction users, or spellcasters.
