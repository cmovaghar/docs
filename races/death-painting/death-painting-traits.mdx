At the beginning of the Meiji Era, a woman with a unique genetic composition gave birth to a half-human, half-curse child. Her mysterious pregnancy led to her being ostracized by her family. With her child in hand, she sought refuge in a temple operated by jujutsu sorcerers. However, Noritoshi Kamo, known as the most evil sorcerer in history, subjected both the woman and her child to his cruel experiments. She endured nine pregnancies and nine abortions, though all records of her existence and suffering were eventually erased.

In their cursed object form, the Death Painting Wombs appear as small, human-like fetuses incapable of independent action. When ingested by a human, a Death Painting Womb incarnates into a full half-human, half-cursed spirit with the ability to wield jujutsu. The vessel can be anyone, regardless of innate talent or sorcerous potential.

As a Death Painting, you have the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2.

***Age.*** As a half-curse, your lifespan is infinite. While your vessel may age and die, you will continue to exist as a cursed object.

***Alignment.*** Death Paintings are inherently loyal to their siblings, making them naturally Lawful.

***Size.*** Your size is Medium. However, if you choose the Near-Curse subrace, you can be Small instead.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 10 meters.

***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

***Body Owner.*** This body is yours, and no one can take it from you. You have advantage on saving throws against effects that would alter your form. Additionally, you count as an Undead creature.

***Inhuman Durability.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 2. This increase applies again every time you gain a level in your class.

***Toxic Blood.*** Your blood possesses unique toxic properties. Choose one of the following.

- ***Poisonous.*** When your blood comes into contact with a creature, it takes 1d12 poison damage at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. Additionally, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, it is knocked prone, its movement speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn, and it becomes poisoned. Poison damage from this feature bypasses resistances and immunities. Creatures with the Reinforced Immune System feat are immune to this effect.
- ***Rotting.*** When your blood comes into contact with a creature, it takes 2d6 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. Necrotic damage from this feature bypasses resistances and immunities.

A creature can remove your blood from their body by making a Medicine check against your Toxic Blood DC as an action.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.
