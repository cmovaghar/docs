Cursed Vessels are born from the process of incarnation, which occurs when the remains of a sorcerer transform into a cursed object and are ingested by another individual. This fusion between a cursed object and human flesh results in the creation of a Cursed Vessel. In most cases, the host’s body is fully overtaken, and their consciousness is entirely suppressed. The incarnated individual gains access to the vessel’s memories, knowledge, and common sense through the host’s brain.

Cursed Vessels have the appearance of the original race who has consumed the cursed object, but generally having markings around their face and arms, or having other unnatural features.
