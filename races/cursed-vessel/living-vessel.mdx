Living vessels are rare, as resisting cursed objects is an incredibly difficult task. However, once a creature successfully resists a cursed object, they become its vessel. This often results in a life of suffering, as they must share their body with a force that constantly seeks to overtake them.

You gain the following traits.

***Unauthorized Takeover.*** Whenever you roll for initiative or are knocked unconscious, you must make a Wisdom saving throw against the cursed object’s DC. On a failure, the cursed object gains control of your body for a number of minutes equal to its level or CR (whichever is higher) + its Charisma modifier. At the beginning of the cursed object’s turn, you may make another Wisdom saving throw to regain control of your body on a success. If the cursed object possesses you, you regain all of your hit points while it is in control.

***Innate Talk.*** The cursed object within you can force you to communicate with it. At any time, the cursed object may pull you into its Innate Domain—its soul. There, you can converse with it until it releases you, bringing you back to the real world. No matter how long the conversation feels, only a second passes in the real world.

***Incarnated Body.*** Despite your resistance to the cursed object you have consumed, your body still takes on traits of it as a result of the incarnation process. You will gain new features that resemble the object in its first life, depending on its strength. These might include small slits beneath your eyes where two new pairs of eyes could open, or faint lightning marks on your face. Additionally, you will gain one body feat of the DM’s choice that the cursed object possesses. This can also be a non-body feat that directly pertains to the body, such as the Energy to Blood feat.
