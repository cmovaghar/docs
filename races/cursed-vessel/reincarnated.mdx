You gain the following traits.

***Life Experience.*** This isn’t your first life, and the last time around, you gained valuable knowledge. You gain proficiency in two skills or one skill and one tool of your choice.

***Cling on to Life.*** You have died once, and you’re determined not to let it happen again. Whenever you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. You can use this feature once per long rest.

***Full Suppression.*** The other soul within the body you inhabit is so completely crushed and dominated that it feels as if it was never there at all. You do not share this body. As a Cursed Vessel, you do not gain the Soul Outline Awareness or Soul Learning traits.
