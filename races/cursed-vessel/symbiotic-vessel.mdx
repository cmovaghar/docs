You gain the following traits.

***Always Awake.*** Your cursed object is constantly vigilant, watching for danger around you. Creatures cannot gain advantage on attack rolls against you solely because they are unseen.

***Experience of Two.*** The cursed object within you shares knowledge from its past life, offering valuable guidance. Whenever you make a skill check, you can roll with advantage if the cursed object has knowledge of the subject. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses after a long rest.
