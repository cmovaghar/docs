You gain the following traits.

***Owner’s Will.*** Whenever you use any features from your original body (such as your cursed technique) to harm creatures or objects that the body’s owner cares for, your power is drastically reduced. Your damage is cut to 1/10 of its total (rounded up) whenever you deal damage, and your range is reduced to 1/10 of its maximum (rounded to the nearest 1 meter), unless the range is touch.

***Destruction of Will.*** You can become a complete vessel by doing the following. First, you must submerge yourself in a pool of blood for the entirety of a short rest. Then, you must either kill a loved one of the host using only the host’s features or destroy the thing they held most dear during their life. Once both conditions are met, their soul will be consumed by darkness, and they will lose their will to live. You will then become a Complete Vessel and gain the following traits.

## Complete Vessel
***Soul Damage.*** You have learned to harness the soul trapped within you to absorb damage. You gain a pool of hit points equal to the maximum hit points the creature you are possessing once had. Whenever you take damage, you can expend cursed energy up to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus (minimum of 1) to reduce the damage. For each point of cursed energy spent, you remove 10 hit points from the pool, and the damage is reduced by the same amount. The pool fully replenishes after you complete a long rest.

***Perfect Reincarnation.*** You have mastered what is thought to be impossible: a method to reincarnate into your original body. After spending at least one day as a Complete Vessel, you can use an action—or a reaction when you take damage—to transform into your original form. Upon doing so, you regain all the benefits associated with your original body but lose the ability scores, size, speed, and all the features gained from being a Cursed Vessel, except Soul Outline Awareness. The host’s soul remains trapped within you.
