You gain the following traits.

***Cursed Technique.*** Because your soul once possessed a technique, you can gain one as a Cursed Corpse.

***Cling to Life.*** Having already experienced death, your soul refuses to go through it again. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you may choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. You can use this ability once per long rest.
