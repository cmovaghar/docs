Cursed Corpses are created by sorcerers who imbue a core with energy and a soul, granting them life and independent thought. Some corpses contain multiple cores and souls, allowing them to switch between them at will.

Their appearances vary greatlyâ€”some resemble animals, while others take on a more mechanical, robotic form. A Cursed Corpse's appearance is entirely determined by its creator's methods.

Although they possess free will and can think independently, they often retain the habits of the soul they were modeled after.

As a Cursed Corpse, you have the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** You can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. Your scores cannot exceed 20 in this way.

***Age.*** You do not age and can live indefinitely.

***Alignment.*** Cursed Corpses can have any alignment, but they generally share the alignment of the soul they were made from.

***Size.*** Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 10 meters.

***Constructed Being.*** You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe. You do not need to sleep and are immune to being poisoned and poison damage. Your creature type is Construct (specifically, Cursed Corpse). Because you were not born, you cannot gain a Cursed Technique.

***Body Modifications.*** You start with six materials of appropriate size and any kind, all of which are Grade 4. These materials can be used to acquire [Modifications](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Cursed_Corpse_Creation_(Jujutsu_Kaisen_Supplement)#Modifications), in addition to the free ones you start with. You have a number of modification slots equal to your proficiency bonus plus half your proficiency bonus. You cannot take multiple Hit Die Upgrade, Damage Reduction Upgrade, or Extra Attack modifications.

To add modifications beyond the ones obtained from your starting six Grade 4 materials, another creature (controlled by someone other than you) with the Cursed Corpse Creator feat, Puppet Manipulation Cursed Technique, or Cursed Corpse Expert sorcerer path must modify you over the course of a long rest. They must remain within 1 meter of you for at least one hour. Adding modifications this way treats you as an NPC Cursed Corpse, though ability modifications still cannot raise your ability scores above 20. Feats granted by modifications only require the person modifying you to understand the feat and how it works, rather than possessing the feat themselves.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.

***Subrace.*** There are two forms of sentient Cursed Corpses: Reincarnated Corpses, which are based on the souls of dead sorcerers, and Abrupt-Mutation Cursed Corpses, which possess three different cores, each with an animal modification.
